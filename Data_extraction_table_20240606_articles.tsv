Neuroimmune signatures in chronic low back pain subtypes	BRAIN	We recently showed that patients with different chronic pain conditions (such as chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and Gulf War illness) demonstrated elevated brain and/or spinal cord levels of the glial marker 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which suggests that neuroinflammation might be a pervasive phenomenon observable across multiple aetiologically heterogeneous pain disorders. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of this neuroinflammatory signal appears to exhibit a degree of disease specificity (e.g. with respect to the involvement of the primary somatosensory cortex), suggesting that different pain conditions may exhibit distinct 'neuroinflammatory signatures'. To explore this hypothesis further, we tested whether neuroinflammatory signal can characterize putative aetiological subtypes of chronic low back pain patients based on clinical presentation. Specifically, we explored neuroinflammation in patients whose chronic low back pain either did or did not radiate to the leg (i.e. 'radicular' versus 'axial' back pain). Fifty-four patients with chronic low back pain, 26 with axial back pain [43.7 +/- 16.6 years old (mean +/- SD)] and 28 with radicular back pain (48.3 +/- 13.2 years old), underwent PET/MRI with C-11-PBR28, a second-generation radioligand for TSPO. C-11-PBR28 signal was quantified using standardized uptake values ratio (validated against volume of distribution ratio; n = 23). Functional MRI data were collected simultaneously to the C-11-PBR28 data (i) to functionally localize the primary somatosensory cortex back and leg subregions; and (ii) to perform functional connectivity analyses (in order to investigate possible neurophysiological correlations of the neuroinflammatory signal). PET and functional MRI measures were compared across groups, cross-correlated with one another and with the severity of 'fibromyalgianess' (i.e. the degree of pain centralization, or 'nociplastic pain'). Furthermore, statistical mediation models were used to explore possible causal relationships between these three variables. For the primary somatosensory cortex representation of back/leg, C-11-PBR28 PET signal and functional connectivity to the thalamus were: (i) higher in radicular compared to axial back pain patients; (ii) positively correlated with each other; (iii) positively correlated with fibromyalgianess scores, across groups; and finally (iv) fibromyalgianess mediated the association between C-11-PBR28 PET signal and primary somatosensory cortex-thalamus connectivity across groups. Our findings support the existence of 'neuroinflammatory signatures' that are accompanied by neurophysiological changes and correlate with clinical presentation (in particular, with the degree of nociplastic pain) in chronic pain patients. These signatures may contribute to the subtyping of distinct pain syndromes and also provide information about interindividual variability in neuroimmune brain signals, within diagnostic groups, that could eventually serve as targets for mechanism-based precision medicine approaches.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

However, acute DoC is rarely investigated, although identifying residual consciousness is key to clinical decision-making in the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, the objective of the prospective, observational, tertiary centre cohort, diagnostic phase IIb study 'Consciousness in neurocritical care cohort study using EEG and fMRI' (CONNECT-ME, NCT02644265) was to assess the accuracy of fMRI and EEG to identify residual consciousness in acute DoC in the ICU. Between April 2016 and November 2020, 87 acute DoC patients with traumatic or non-traumatic brain injury were examined with repeated clinical assessments, fMRI and EEG. Resting-state EEG and EEG with external stimulations were evaluated by visual analysis, spectral band analysis and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) consciousness classifier. In addition, within- and between-network resting-state connectivity for canonical resting-state fMRI networks was assessed. Next, we used EEG and fMRI data at study enrolment in two different machine-learning algorithms (Random Forest and SVM with a linear kernel) to distinguish patients in a minimally conscious state or better (>= MCS) from those in coma or unresponsive wakefulness state (<= UWS) at time of study enrolment and at ICU discharge (or before death). Prediction performances were assessed with area under the curve (AUC). Of 87 DoC patients (mean age, 50.0 +/- 18 years, 43% female), 51 (59%) were <= UWS and 36 (41%) were >= MCS at study enrolment. Thirty-one (36%) patients died in the ICU, including 28 who had life-sustaining therapy withdrawn. EEG and fMRI predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge, with maximum AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.80) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.77-0.80), respectively. Models based on combined EEG and fMRI features predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge with maximum AUCs of 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.86) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), respectively, with improved positive predictive value and sensitivity. Overall, both machine-learning algorithms (SVM and Random Forest) performed equally well. In conclusion, we suggest that acute DoC prediction models in the ICU be based on a combination of fMRI and EEG features, regardless of the machine-learning algorithm used.	87	87	NA	fC only analysed for 64	42	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, denoising with Conn toolbox)	no			#NAAM?

The observed changes correlate with both immediate mood fluctuations and long-term antidepressant outcomes. Deep brain stimulation targeting the subcallosal cingulate area, a hub with multiple axonal projections, has shown therapeutic potential for treatment-resistant mood disorders. While subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation drives long-term metabolic changes in corticolimbic circuits, the brain areas that are directly modulated by electrical stimulation of this region are not known. We used 3.0 T functional MRI to map the topography of acute brain changes produced by stimulation in an initial cohort of 12 patients with fully implanted deep brain stimulation devices targeting the subcallosal cingulate area. Four additional subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation patients were also scanned and employed as a validation cohort. Participants underwent resting state scans (n = 78 acquisitions overall) during (i) inactive deep brain stimulation; (ii) clinically optimal active deep brain stimulation; and (iii) suboptimal active deep brain stimulation. All scans were acquired within a single MRI session, each separated by a 5-min washout period. Analysis of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in each sequence indicated that clinically optimal deep brain stimulation reduced spontaneous brain activity in several areas, including the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, the bilateral precuneus and the left inferior parietal lobule (P-Bonferroni < 0.0001). Stimulation-induced dorsal anterior cingulate cortex signal reduction correlated with immediate within-session mood fluctuations, was greater at optimal versus suboptimal settings and was related to local cingulum bundle engagement. Moreover, linear modelling showed that immediate changes in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus activity could predict individual long-term antidepressant improvement. A model derived from the primary cohort that incorporated amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations changes in these three areas (along with preoperative symptom severity) explained 55% of the variance in clinical improvement in that cohort. The same model also explained 93% of the variance in the out-of-sample validation cohort. Additionally, all three brain areas exhibited significant changes in functional connectivity between active and inactive deep brain stimulation states (P-Bonferroni < 0.01). These results provide insight into the network-level mechanisms of subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation and point towards potential acute biomarkers of clinical response that could help to optimize and personalize this therapy.	985			985 HCP + 16 experiment (12 training, 4 testing)	7	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering)	no			#NAAM?	seed to whole-brain as secondary analysis.

We here assessed the contribution of ipsilesional and contralesional anterior intraparietal cortex (aIPS) for hand motor function in 18 recovered chronic stroke patients and 18 healthy control subjects using a multimodal assessment consisting of resting-state functional MRI, motor task functional MRI, online-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) interference, and 3D movement kinematics. Effects were compared against two control stimulation sites, i.e. contralesional M1 and a sham stimulation condition. We found that patients with good motor outcome compared to patients with more substantial residual deficits featured increased resting-state connectivity between ipsilesional aIPS and contralesional aIPS as well as between ipsilesional aIPS and dorsal premotor cortex. Moreover, interhemispheric connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional M1 as well as ipsilesional aIPS and contralesional M1 correlated with better motor performance across tasks. TMS interference at individual aIPS and M1 coordinates led to differential effects depending on the motor task that was tested, i.e. index finger-tapping, rapid pointing movements, or a reach-grasp-lift task. Interfering with contralesional aIPS deteriorated the accuracy of grasping, especially in patients featuring higher connectivity between ipsi- and contralesional aIPS. In contrast, interference with the contralesional M1 led to impaired grasping speed in patients featuring higher connectivity between bilateral M1. These findings suggest differential roles of contralesional M1 and aIPS for distinct aspects of recovered hand motor function, depending on the reorganization of interhemispheric connectivity.	36	18	18	NA	3	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: age (sample matching), gender (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)	no

The same is true for the observation of stable dynamical structures in otherwise highly non-stationary signals. The present study addresses both problems by the analysis of simultaneous resting state EEG-fMRI recordings of 53 patients with epilepsy. Confirming previous findings, we observe a generic and temporally stable average correlation pattern in EEG recordings. We design a predictor for the General Linear Model describing fluctuations around the stationary EEG correlation pattern and detect resting state networks in fMRI data. The acquired statistical maps are contrasted to several surrogate tests and compared with maps derived by spatial Independent Component Analysis of the fMRI data. By means of the proposed EEG-predictor we observe core nodes of known fMRI resting state networks with high specificity in the default mode, the executive control and the salience network. Our results suggest that both, the stationary EEG pattern as well as resting state fMRI networks are different expressions of the same brain activity. This activity is interpreted as the dynamics on (or close to) a stable attractor in phase space that is necessary to maintain the brain in an efficient operational mode. We discuss that this interpretation is congruent with the theoretical framework of complex systems as well as with the brain's energy balance.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		no

Inside this neurocircuit, an imbalance between distinct striatal projections to basal ganglia output nuclei, either directly or indirectly via the external globus pallidus, is suggested to be relevant for impaired arbitration between facilitation and inhibition of cortically initiated activity. However, current evidence of individually altered cortico-striatal or thalamo-cortical connectivities is insufficient to understand how cortical dysconnections are linked to the imbalanced basal ganglia system in patients. In this study, we aimed to identify aberrant ventrolateral prefronto-basal ganglia-thalamic subnetworks representing direct-indirect imbalance and its association with cognitive inflexibility in patients. To increase network detection sensitivity, we constructed a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network model incorporating striatal, pallidal and thalamic subregions defined by unsupervised clustering in 105 medication-free patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (age = 25.05 +/- 6.55 years, male/female = 70/35) and 99 healthy controls (age = 23.93 +/- 5.80 years, male/female = 64/35). By using the network-based statistic method, we analysed group differences in subnetworks formed by suprathreshold dysconnectivities. Using linear regression models, we tested subnetwork dysconnectivity effects on symptom severity and set-shifting performance assessed by well-validated clinical and cognitive tests. Compared with the healthy controls, patients were slower to track the Part B sequence of the Trail Making Test when the effects of psychomotor and visuospatial functions were adjusted (t= 3.89, P <0.001) and made more extradimensional shift errors (t= 4.09, P < 0.001). In addition to reduced fronto-striatal and striato-external pallidal connectivities and hypoconnected striato-thalamic subnetwork [P = 0.001, family-wise error rate (FWER) corrected], patients had hyperconnected fronto-external pallidal (P = 0.012, FWER corrected) and infra-thalamic (P = 0.015, FWER corrected) subnetworks compared with the healthy controls. Among the patients, the fronto-pallidal subnetwork alteration, especially ventrolateral prefronto-external globus pallidal hyperconnectivity, was associated with relatively fewer extradimensional shifting errors beta = -0.30, P = 0.001). Our findings suggest that the hyperconnected fronto-external pallidal subnetwork may have an opposite effect to the imbalance caused by the reduced indirect pathway (fronto-striato-external pallidal) connectivities in patients. This ventrolateral prefrontal hyperconnectivity may help the external globus pallidus disinhibit basal ganglia output nuclei, which results in behavioural inhibition, so as to compensate for the impaired set shifting. We suggest the ventrolateral prefrontal and external globus pallidus as neuromodulatory targets for inflexible habitual behaviours in obsessive-compulsive disorder.	204	105	99	NA	106	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), other (handedness, IQ (all sample matching)) scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)	no

The claustrum is considered a multimodal computing network due to its reciprocal connections with almost all cortical areas as well as subcortical structures. Although the claustrum has been involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, specific changes in connections of the claustrum remain unclear in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Resting-state fMRI and T1-weighted structural 3D images from healthy elderly (n = 15), AD (n = 16), and PD (n = 12) subjects were analyzed. Seed-based FC analysis was performed using CONN FC toolbox and T1-weighted images were analyzed with the Computational Anatomy Toolbox for voxel-based morphometry analysis. While we observed a decreased FC between the left claustrum and sensorimotor cortex, auditory association cortex, and cortical regions associated with social cognition in PD compared with the healthy control group (HC), no significant difference was found in alterations in the FC of both claustrum comparing the HC and AD groups. In the AD group, high FC of claustrum with regions of sensorimotor cortex and cortical regions related to cognitive control, including cingulate gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and insular cortex were demonstrated. In addition, the structural results show significantly decreased volume in bilateral claustrum in AD and PD compared with HC. There were no significant differences in the claustrum volumes between PD and AD groups so the FC may offer more precise findings in distinguishing changes for claustrum in AD and PD.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- only passage possibly indicative of a network being constructed, but no more information: ""The ROIs used average time series as seed and then the analysis computed the correlation coefficients between these average time series and the BOLD time series at each voxel.

Topographic divergence of atypical cortical asymmetry and atrophy patterns in temporal lobe epilepsy	BRAIN	Temporal lobe epilepsy, a common drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, is primarily a limbic network disorder associated with predominant unilateral hippocampal pathology. Structural MRI has provided an in vivo window into whole-brain grey matter structural alterations in temporal lobe epilepsy relative to controls, by either mapping (i) atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry; or (ii) regional atrophy. However, similarities and differences of both atypical asymmetry and regional atrophy measures have not been systematically investigated. Here, we addressed this gap using the multisite ENIGMA-Epilepsy dataset comprising MRI brain morphological measures in 732 temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 1418 healthy controls. We compared spatial distributions of grey matter asymmetry and atrophy in temporal lobe epilepsy, contextualized their topographies relative to spatial gradients in cortical microstructure and functional connectivity calculated using 207 healthy controls obtained from Human Connectome Project and an independent dataset containing 23 temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 53 healthy controls and examined clinical associations using machine learning. We identified a marked divergence in the spatial distribution of atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry and regional atrophy mapping. The former revealed a temporo-limbic disease signature while the latter showed diffuse and bilateral patterns. Our findings were robust across individual sites and patients. Cortical atrophy was significantly correlated with disease duration and age at seizure onset, while degrees of asymmetry did not show a significant relationship to these clinical variables. Our findings highlight that the mapping of atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry and regional atrophy tap into two complementary aspects of temporal lobe epilepsy-related pathology, with the former revealing primary substrates in ipsilateral limbic circuits and the latter capturing bilateral disease effects. These findings refine our notion of the neuropathology of temporal lobe epilepsy and may inform future discovery and validation of complementary MRI biomarkers in temporal lobe epilepsy.	76	23	53	AND 207 from HCP	68	NA	full correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: other (site (sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological noise (ICA-FIX denoising to remove cardiac/respiration artifacts, high-pass filtering)	no		  	#NAAM?

Hadi	The Effect of Body Posture on Resting-State Functional Connectivity	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY	Introduction: An important but under-investigated confound of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is body posture. Although it is well established that body position changes cerebral blood flow, the amount of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, intracranial pressure, and even the firing rate of certain cell types, there is currently no study that directly examines its effect on fMRI measurements. Moreover, fMRI is typically done in a supine position, which often does not correspond to how these processes are performed in everyday settings.Methods: In this study, 20 healthy adults underwent resting-state fMRI under three body positions: supine, right lateral decubitus (RLD), and left lateral decubitus (LLD). We first investigated whether there were differences in overall organization of whole-brain connectivity between conditions using graph theory. Second, we examined whether functional connectivity of two most studied default mode network (DMN) seeds to the rest of the brain was altered as a function of body position.Results: Nonparametric statistical analyses revealed that global network measures differed among conditions, with the supine and LLD showing identical results which differed when compared to the RLD. There was decreased connectivity for DMN seeds in the RLD condition compared to the supine and LLD, but there were no significant differences between the latter two conditions.Discussion: Potential mechanisms underlying these alterations include gravity, changes in physiology, and body anatomy. Our results suggest that, compared to supine and LLD, the RLD position leads to changes in whole-brain and DMN connectivity. Finally, depending on the research question, combining imaging modalities that allow for more naturalistic settings provides a better understanding of certain phenomena. Impact statementFunctional connectivity is sensitive to several confounds, including motion, heart rate, and respiration. Body posture is also an important but under-investigated confound. In this study, healthy adults were scanned in three different positions to investigate whether posture results in changes in connectivity. We found that connectivity was identical if participants were facing up or lying on their left, but it was altered when they were lying on their right. Results suggest that posture can lead to connectivity changes and, in some cases, the combined use of functional magnetic resonance imaging with other techniques might provide a better understanding of the phenomenon of interest.	20	NA	NA	NA	132	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering), other (session) 	no								
Burkhardt, M and Thiel, CM and Giessing, C and Burkhardt, Micha and Thiel, Christiane M. and Giessing, Carsten	Robust Correlation for Link Definition in Resting-State fMRI Brain Networks Can Reduce Motion-Related Artifacts	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY	Introduction: It is well known that even small head movements introduce artifacts in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, and over the years, numerous methods were introduced to correct for this issue. The field of robust statistics, however, has not yet received much attention in this regard. In this article, we tested a recently developed statistical method called wrapping and compared it with two already established methods: data scrubbing and an independent component analysis-based approach for the automatic removal of motion artifacts (ICA-AROMA).Methods: A group of N = 120 healthy adult subjects were divided into high and low movement cohorts. The functional connectomes following wrapping, data scrubbing, and ICA-AROMA of the high movement cohort were compared with the mean functional connectome of the low movement cohort.Results and Discussion: Our results showed that wrapping could significantly decrease the Euclidean distance between connectomes of the two cohorts. Furthermore, wrapping was able to compensate the systematic effect of increased short distance correlations and reduced long distance correlations in functional connectomes, which often result from high subject motion. Our findings suggest that wrapping constitutes a valuable approach to correct for movement-related artifacts when estimating functional connectivity in the brain. Impact statementThe influence of subject motion on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is still an actively discussed topic. However, to handle this problem, the field of robust statistics has not been given much attention yet. We want to fill this void by introducing and validating a recently developed method for calculating robust correlations.

Such network rewiring may differ across spatial scales; however, the global and local alterations in brain systems remain elusive in human sleep. Materials and Methods: We examined cross-scale changes of brain networks in sleep. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 28 healthy participants during nocturnal sleep. We adopted both metrics of connectivity (functional connectivity [FC] and regional homogeneity [ReHo]) and complexity (multiscale entropy) to explore the global and local functionality of the neural assembly across nonrapid eye movement sleep stages. Results: Long-range FC decreased with sleep depth, whereas local ReHo peaked at the N2 stage and reached its lowest level at the N3 stage. Entropy exhibited a general decline at the local scale (Scale 1) as sleep deepened, whereas the coarse-scale entropy (Scale 3) was consistent across stages. Discussion: The negative correlation between Scale-1 entropy and ReHo reflects the enhanced signal regularity and synchronization in sleep, identifying the information exchange at the local scale. The N2 stage showed a distinctive pattern toward local information processing with scrambled long-distance information exchange, indicating a specific time window for network reorganization. Collectively, the multidimensional metrics indicated an imbalanced global-local relationship among brain functional networks across sleep-wake stages.	28	NA	NA	NA	261	NA	full correlation	not specified	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, signal drift by system instability), physiological (respiration/cardiac pulsations, band-pass filtering)	no				Within and between network connectivity.

Given the widespread neural alterations observed in MS, predictive modeling approaches that capitalize on whole-brain connectivity may better capture individual differences in WM.Materials and Methods: We applied connectome-based predictive modeling to functional magnetic resonance imaging data from WM tasks in two independent samples with relapsing-remitting MS. In the internal sample (n(internal) = 36), cross-validation was used to train a model to predict accuracy on the Paced Visual Serial Addition Test from functional connectivity. We hypothesized that this MS-specific model would successfully predict performance on the N-back task in the validation cohort (n(validation) = 36). In addition, we assessed the generalizability of existing WM networks derived in healthy young adults to these samples, and we explored anatomical differences between the healthy and MS networks.Results: We successfully derived an MS-specific predictive model of WM in the internal sample (full: r(s) = 0.47, permuted p = 0.011), but the predictions were not significant in the validation cohort (r(s) = -0.047; p = 0.78, mean squared error [MSE] = 0.006, R-2 = -2.21%). In contrast, the healthy networks successfully predicted WM in both MS samples (internal: r(s) = 0.33 p = 0.049, MSE = 0.009, R-2 = 13.4%; validation cohort: r(s) = 0.46, p = 0.005, MSE = 0.005, R-2 = 16.9%), demonstrating their translational potential.Discussion: Functional networks identified in a large sample of healthy individuals predicted significant variance in WM in MS. Networks derived in small samples of people with MS may have limited generalizability, potentially due to disease-related heterogeneity. The robustness of models derived in large clinical samples warrants further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03244696. Impact statementWorking memory deficits in people with multiple sclerosis have important consequences for employment, leisure, and activities of daily living. Identifying a functional connectivity-based marker that accurately captures individual differences in working memory may offer a useful target for cognitive rehabilitation. We demonstrate that machine learning can be applied to whole-brain functional connectivity data to identify networks that predict individual-level working memory in people with multiple sclerosis. However, existing network-based models of working memory derived in healthy adults outperform those identified in multiple sclerosis, suggesting translational potential of brain networks derived in large, healthy samples for predicting cognition in multiple sclerosis.	72	NA	NA	- 36 internal validation + 36 external validation	252	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (cross validation)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (global signal regression)	no			"- edge selection: ""The final networks, containing edges that appeared in every round of cross validation, contained 189 edges in the high-WM network and 214 edges in the low-WM network"" - weights: no mention"

However, it is unclear how genomic differences driven by disease state can affect this relationship. Here, we integrate from the ABIDE I and II imaging cohorts with datasets of gene expression in brains of neurotypical individuals and individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with regionally matched brain activity measurements from fMRI datasets. We identify genes linked with brain activity whose association is disrupted in ASD. We identified a subset of genes that showed a differential developmental trajectory in individuals with ASD compared with controls. These genes are enriched in voltage-gated ion channels and inhibitory neurons, pointing to excitation-inhibition imbalance in ASD. We further assessed differences at the regional level showing that the primary visual cortex is the most affected region in ASD. Our results link disrupted brain expression patterns of individuals with ASD to brain activity and show developmental, cell type, and regional enrichment of activity linked genes. Gene expression patterns have been associated with functional activity patterns in the brain. Here the authors determine how gene expression patterns in the human brain supports brain phenotypes obtained from resting state fMRI imaging, identifying brain regions and genes relevant to autism.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Changes in Brain Functional and Effective Connectivity After Treatment for Breast Cancer and Implications for Intervention Targets	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY	Background: Patients with breast cancer frequently report cognitive impairment both during and after completion of therapy. Evidence suggests that cancer-related cognitive impairments are related to widespread neural network dysfunction. The default mode network (DMN) is a large conserved network that plays a critical role in integrating the functions of various neural systems. Disruption of the network may play a key role in the development of cognitive impairment.Methods: We compared neuroimaging and neurocognitive data from 43 newly diagnosed primary breast cancer patients (mean age = 48, standard deviation [SD] = 8.9 years) and 50 frequency-matched healthy female controls (mean age = 50, SD = 10 years) before treatment and 1 year after treatment completion. Functional and effective connectivity measures of the DMN were obtained using graph theory and Bayesian network analysis methods, respectively.Results: Compared with healthy females, the breast cancer group displayed higher global efficiency and path length post-treatment (p < 0.03, corrected). Breast cancer survivors showed significantly lower performance on measures of verbal memory, attention, and verbal fluency (p < 0.05) at both time points. Within the DMN, local brain network organization, as measured by edge-betweenness centralities, was significantly altered in the breast cancer group compared with controls at both time points (p < 0.0001, corrected), with several connections showing a significant group-by-time effect (p < 0.003, corrected). Effective connectivity demonstrated significantly altered patterns of neuronal coupling in patients with breast cancer (p < 0.05). Significant correlations were seen between hormone blockade therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy cycles, memory, and verbal fluency test and edge-betweenness centralities.Discussion: This pattern of altered network organization in the default mode is believed to result in reduced network efficiency and disrupted communication. Subregions of the DMN, the orbital prefrontal cortex and posterior memory network, appear to be at the center of this disruption and this could inform future interventions. Impact statementThis prospective study is the first to investigate how post-treatment changes in functional and effective connectivity in the regions of default mode network are related to cancer therapy and measures of memory and verbal learning in breast cancer patients. We demonstrate that the interactions between treatment, brain connectivity, and neurocognitive outcomes coalesce around a subgroup of brain structures in the orbital frontal and parietal lobe. This would suggest that interventions that target these regions may improve neurocognitive outcomes in breast cancer survivors.	93	43	50	NA	51	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering to remove physiological and non-neuronal noise factors)	no			"- network size: originally 90 ROIs used, then 11 ROIs selected; used their average as network size - weights: ""We modeled the DMN for each participant as a system of nodes and edges representing regions and their normalized temporal correlations, respectively."" - thresholding: ""connectivity properties were measured across connection densities (thresholds) from minimum connection density to the maximum biologically plausible density of 50% (Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2006) at intervals of 1% connection density."""

However, our understanding of their relevance in terms of cognition remains insufficient.Materials and Methods: In response, this study aims at investigating the patterns of different network properties (resting-state activity [RSA] and short- and long-range functional connectivity [FC]) in these three core rsNWs, as well as the dynamics of age-associated changes and their relation to cognitive performance in a sample of healthy controls (N = 74) covering a large age span (20-79 years). Using a whole-network based approach, three measures were calculated from the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data: amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree of network centrality (DC). The cognitive test battery covered the following domains: memory, executive functioning, processing speed, attention, and visual perception.Results: For all three fMRI measures (ALFF, ReHo, and DC), the highest values of spontaneous brain activity (ALFF), short- and long-range connectivity (ReHo, DC) were observed in the DMN and the lowest in the SN. Significant age-associated decrease was observed in the DMN for ALFF and DC, and in the SN for ALFF and ReHo. Significant negative partial correlations were observed for working memory and ALFF in all three networks, as well as for additional cognitive parameters and ALFF in CEN.Discussion: Our results show that higher RSA in the three core rsNWs may have an unfavorable effect on cognition. Conversely, the pattern of network properties in healthy subjects included low RSA and FC in the SN. This complements previous research related to the three core rsNW and shows that the chosen approach can provide additional insight into their function. Impact statementUsing a whole network-based approach, our study characterizes the normal patterns (including resting-state activity [RSA], short- and long-range functional connectivity [FC]) of three prominent resting-state networks (rsNW) within the context of age-dependent changes and explores their relevance for different cognitive domains. Our results revealed a pattern with low RSA and FC in the salience network in healthy volunteers, whereas higher RSA, particularly in the central executive network, seemed to have a negative effect on cognition. These results increase the knowledge about the three core rsNWs and the understanding about their relevance for cognition.	74	NA	74	NA	90	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance regression, band pass filtering).	no			"- weights: ""The DC measure was computed based on a Pearson correlation coefficient cut-off of 0.25 ( p = 0.001)"""

These functions seem to be distinctly compromised in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), including alterations of the allostatic-interoceptive network (AIN). Here, we hypothesize that bvFTD is typified by an allostatic-interoceptive overload. METHODS: We assessed resting-state heartbeat evoked potential (rsHEP) modulation as well as its behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging correlates in patients with bvFTD relative to healthy control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (N = 94). We measured 1) resting-state electroencephalography (to assess the rsHEP, prompted by visceral inputs and modulated by internal body sensing), 2) associations between rsHEP and its neural generators (source location), 3) cognitive disturbances (cognitive state, executive functions, facial emotion recognition), 4) brain atrophy, and 5) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity (AIN vs. control networks). RESULTS: Relative to healthy control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with bvFTD presented more negative rsHEP amplitudes with sources in critical hubs of the AIN (insula, amygdala, somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex). This exacerbated rsHEP modulation selectively predicted the patients' cognitive profile (including cognitive decline, executive dysfunction, and emotional impairments). In addition, increased rsHEP modulation in bvFTD was associated with decreased brain volume and connectivity of the AIN. Machine learning results confirmed AIN specificity in predicting the bvFTD group. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results suggest that bvFTD may be characterized by an allostatic-interoceptive overload manifested in ongoing electrophysiological markers, brain atrophy, functional networks, and cognition.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- DFC - supplement: ""To calculate the networks, we employed a non-linear dynamic connectivity fluctuation analysis (DCFA)(32), which includes Dynamic Functional Connectivity (DFC)..."""

Multimodal Neurocognitive Markers of Naturalistic Discourse Typify Diverse Neurodegenerative Diseases	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Neurodegeneration has multiscalar impacts, including behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurofunctional disruptions. Can disease-differential alterations be captured across such dimensions using naturalistic stimuli? To address this question, we assessed comprehension of four naturalistic stories, highlighting action, nonaction, social, and nonsocial events, in Parkinson's disease (PD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) relative to Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls. Text-specific correlates were evaluated via voxel-based morphometry, spatial (fMRI), and temporal (hd-EEG) functional connectivity. PD patients presented action-text deficits related to the volume of action-observation regions, connectivity across motor-related and multimodal-semantic hubs, and frontal hd-EEG hypoconnectivity. BvFTD patients exhibited social-text deficits, associated with atrophy and spatial connectivity patterns along social-network hubs, alongside right frontotemporal hd-EEG hypoconnectivity. Alzheimer's disease patients showed impairments in all stories, widespread atrophy and spatial connectivity patterns, and heightened occipitotemporal hd-EEG connectivity. Our framework revealed disease-specific signatures across behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurofunctional dimensions, highlighting the sensitivity and specificity of a single naturalistic task. This investigation opens a translational agenda combining ecological approaches and multimodal cognitive neuroscience for the study of neurodegeneration. 	109	68	41	- patient: 25 (PD), 20 (bvFTD), 23 (AD)	116	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering)	no			#NAAM?

While several studies have suggested that this circuitry exhibits functional changes across the first two decades of life, findings have been mixed - perhaps resulting from differences in analytic choices across studies. Here we used multiverse analyses to examine the robustness of task-based amygdala-mPFC function findings to analytic choices within the context of an accelerated longitudinal design (4-22 years-old; N = 98; 183 scans; 1-3 scans/participant). Participants recruited from the greater Los Angeles area completed an event-related emotional face (fear, neutral) task. Parallel analyses varying in preprocessing and modeling choices found that age-related change estimates for amygdala reactivity were more robust than task-evoked amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity to varied analytical choices. Specification curves indicated evidence for age-related decreases in amygdala reactivity to faces, though within-participant changes in amygdala reactivity could not be differentiated from between-participant differences. In contrast, amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity results varied across methods much more, and evidence for age-related change in amygdala-mPFC connectivity was not consistent. Generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) measurements of connectivity were especially sensitive to whether a deconvolution step was applied. Our findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the robustness of findings to analysis choices, although the age-related changes in our current work cannot be overinterpreted given low test-retest reliability. Together, these findings highlight both the challenges in estimating developmental change in longitudinal cohorts and the value of multiverse approaches in developmental neuroimaging for assessing robustness of results.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Association of network connectivity via resting state functional MRI with consciousness, mortality, and outcomes in neonatal acute brain injury	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Background: An accurate and comprehensive test of integrated brain network function is needed for neonates during the acute brain injury period to inform on morbidity. This retrospective cohort study assessed whether integrated brain network function acquired by resting state functional MRI during the acute period in neonates with brain injury, is associated with acute exam, neonatal mortality, and 6-month outcomes. Methods: Study subjects included 40 consecutive neonates with resting state functional MRI acquired within 31 days after suspected brain insult from March 2018 to July 2019 at Phoenix Children's Hospital. Acute-period exam and test results were assigned ordinal scores based on severity as documented by respective treating specialists. Analyses (Fisher exact, Wilcoxon-rank sum test, ordinal/multinomial logistic regression) examined association of resting state networks with demographics, presentation, neurological exam, electroencephalogram, anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, passive task functional MRI, and outcomes of discharge condition, outpatient development, motor tone, seizure, and mortality. Results: Subjects had a mean (standard deviation) gestational age of 37.8 (2.6) weeks, a majority were male (63%), with a diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (68%). Findings at birth included mild distress (48%), moderately abnormal neurological exam (33%), and consciousness characterized as awake but irritable (40%). Significant associations after multiple testing corrections were detected for resting state networks: basal ganglia with outpatient developmental delay (odds ratio [OR], 14.5; 99.4% confidence interval [CI], 2.00-105; P <.001) and motor tone/weakness (OR, 9.98; 99.4% CI, 1.72-57.9; P <.001); language/frontoparietal network with discharge condition (OR, 5.13; 99.4% CI, 1.22-21.5; P =.002) and outpatient developmental delay (OR, 4.77; 99.4% CI, 1.21-18.7; P=.002); default mode network with discharge condition (OR, 3.72; 99.4% CI, 1.01-13.78; P=.006) and neurological exam (P =.002 (FE); OR, 11.8; 99.4% CI, 0.73-191; P =.01 (OLR)); and seizure onset zone with motor tone/weakness (OR, 3.31; 99.4% CI, 1.08-10.1; P=.003). Resting state networks were not detected in three neonates, who died prior to discharge. Conclusions: This study provides level 3 evidence (OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group) demonstrating that in neonatal acute brain injury, the degree of abnormality of resting state networks is associated with acute exam and outcomes. Total lack of brain network detection was only found in patients who did not survive.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		no

However, traditional statistical methods are hard to explore this heterogeneity pattern. We proposed a ""brain dimension"" method to describe the atypical FC patterns of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (BD). The approach was firstly applied to a simulation dataset. It was then utilized to a real resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset of 47 individuals with major depressive disorder, 32 individuals with BD, and 52 well matched health controls. Our method showed a better ability to extract the FC dimensions than traditional methods. The results of the real dataset revealed atypical FC dimensions for major depressive disorder and BD. Especially, an atypical FC dimension which exhibited decreased FC strength of thalamus and basal ganglia was found with higher severity level of individuals with BD than the ones with major depressive disorder. This study provided a novel ""brain dimension"" method to view the atypical FC patterns of major depressive disorder and BD and revealed shared and specific atypical FC patterns between major depressive disorder and BD."	131	79	52	- patients: 47 (MDD), 32 (BD)	160	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filter), age, gender, other (handedness, education)	no			#NAAM?

Post-stroke outcomes predicted from multivariate lesion-behaviour and lesion network mapping	BRAIN	Clinicians and scientists alike have long sought to predict the course and severity of chronic post-stroke cognitive and motor outcomes, as the ability to do so would inform treatment and rehabilitation strategies. However, it remains difficult to make accurate predictions about chronic post-stroke outcomes due, in large part, to high inter-individual variability in recovery and a reliance on clinical heuristics rather than empirical methods. The neuroanatomical location of a stroke is a key variable associated with long-term outcomes, and because lesion location can be derived from routinely collected clinical neuroimaging data there is an opportunity to use this information to make empirically based predictions about post-stroke deficits. For example, lesion location can be compared to statistically weighted multivariate lesion-behaviour maps of neuroanatomical regions that, when damaged, are associated with specific deficits based on aggregated outcome data from large cohorts. Here, our goal was to evaluate whether we can leverage lesion-behaviour maps based on data from two large cohorts of individuals with focal brain lesions to make predictions of 12-month cognitive and motor outcomes in an independent sample of stroke patients. Further, we evaluated whether we could augment these predictions by estimating the structural and functional networks disrupted in association with each lesion-behaviour map through the use of structural and functional lesion network mapping, which use normative structural and functional connectivity data from neurologically healthy individuals to elucidate lesion-associated networks. We derived these brain network maps using the anatomical regions with the strongest association with impairment for each cognitive and motor outcome based on lesion-behaviour map results. These peak regional findings became the 'seeds' to generate networks, an approach that offers potentially greater precision compared to previously used single-lesion approaches. Next, in an independent sample, we quantified the overlap of each lesion location with the lesion-behaviour maps and structural and functional lesion network mapping and evaluated how much variance each could explain in 12-month behavioural outcomes using a latent growth curve statistical model. We found that each lesion-deficit mapping modality was able to predict a statistically significant amount of variance in cognitive and motor outcomes. Both structural and functional lesion network maps were able to predict variance in 12-month outcomes beyond lesion-behaviour mapping. Functional lesion network mapping performed best for the prediction of language deficits, and structural lesion network mapping performed best for the prediction of motor deficits. Altogether, these results support the notion that lesion location and lesion network mapping can be combined to improve the prediction of post-stroke deficits at 12-months. Predicting stroke outcomes is challenging, due in part to high levels of interindividual variability. Bowren et al. show that the structural and functional networks affected by a stroke provide information that can account for individual differences in outcomes, beyond that provided by lesion location alone.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- explicitly state thresholded + untresholded (p. 1343)	seed to whole-brain analysis.

In the parietal lobe, 2 grasp-related areas collaborate to orchestrate an accurate grasping action: dorsolateral area AIP and dorsomedial area V6A. Single-cell recordings in monkeys and fMRI studies in humans have suggested that both these areas specify grip aperture and wrist orientation, but encode these grasping parameters differently, depending on the context. To elucidate the causal role of phAIP and hV6A, we stimulated these areas, while participants were performing grasping actions (unperturbed grasping). rTMS over phAIP impaired the wrist orientation process, whereas stimulation over hV6A impaired grip aperture encoding. In a small percentage of trials, an unexpected reprogramming of grip aperture or wrist orientation was required (perturbed grasping). In these cases, rTMS over hV6A or over phAIP impaired reprogramming of both grip aperture and wrist orientation. These results represent the first direct demonstration of a different encoding of grasping parameters by 2 grasp-related parietal areas.														yes	wrong outcome (acquisition)		#NAAM?

White matter properties underlying reading abilities differ in 8-year-old children born full term and preterm: A multi-modal approach	NEUROIMAGE	Many diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) studies document associations between reading skills and fractional anisotropy (FA) within brain white matter, suggesting that efficient transfer of information across the brain contributes to individual differences in reading. Use of complementary imaging methods can determine if these associations relate to myelin content of white matter tracts. Compared to children born at term (FT), children born preterm (PT) are at risk for reading deficits. We used two MRI methods to calculate associations of reading and white matter properties in FT and PT children. Participants (N=79: 36 FT and 43 PT) were administered the Gray’s Oral Reading Test at age 8. We segmented three dorsal (left arcuate and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus) and four ventral (bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus and bilateral uncinate) tracts and quantified (1) FA from dMRI and (2) R1 from quantitative T1 relaxometry. We examined correlations between reading scores and these metrics along the trajectories of the tracts. Reading positively correlated with FA in segments of left arcuate and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi in FT children; no FA associations were found in PT children. Reading positively correlated with R1 in segments of the left superior longitudinal, right uncinate, and left inferior longitudinal fasciculi in PT children; no R1 associations were found in FT children. Birth group significantly moderated the associations of reading and white matter metrics. Myelin content of white matter may contribute to individual differences in PT but not FT children.														yes	wrong outcome (acquisition)		#NAAM?		no

Functional neuroanatomy of English word reading in early bilingual and monolingual adults	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Skilled reading is important in daily life. While the understanding of the neurofunctional organization of this uniquely human skill has advanced significantly, it does not take into consideration the common bilingual experiences around the world. To examine the role of early bilingualism on the neural substrates supporting English word processing, we compared brain activity, as well as functional connectivity, in Spanish-English early bilingual adults (N = 25) and English monolingual adults (N = 33) during single-word processing. Activation analysis revealed no significant differences between the two groups. A seed-to-voxel analysis using eight a priori selected seed-regions (placed in regions known to be involved in reading) revealed relatively stronger functional connectivity in bilinguals between two sets of regions: left superior temporal gyrus seed positively with left lingual gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus seed negatively with left anterior cingulate cortex. Together these results suggest that an early Spanish-English bilingual experience does not modulate local brain activity for English word reading. It does, however, have some influence on the functional intercommunication between brain regions during reading, specifically in two regions associated with reading, which are functionally connected to those inside and outside of the reading network. We conclude that brain regions involved in processing English words are not that different in Spanish-English early bilingual adults relative to monolingual adult users of English.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

The frontal parietal network (FPN) is indispensable to executive functioning. Yet, how they interplay to support cognitive development remains elusive. Using longitudinal developmental fMRI with an n-back paradigm, we show a heterogeneity of maturational changes in multivoxel activity and network connectivity among DMN and FPN nodes in 528 children and 103 young adults. Compared with adults, children exhibited prominent longitudinal improvement but still inferior behavioral performance, which paired with less pronounced DMN deactivation and weaker FPN activation in children, but stronger DMN coupling with FPN regions. Children's DMN reached an adult-like level earlier than FPN at both multivoxel activity pattern and intranetwork connectivity levels. Intrinsic DMN-FPN internetwork coupling in children mediated the relationship between age and working memory-related functional coupling of these networks, with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) coupling emerging as most prominent pathway. Coupling of PCC-DLPFC may further work together with task-invoked activity in PCC to account for longitudinal improvement in behavioral performance in children. Our findings suggest that the DMN provides a scaffolding effect in support of an immature FPN that is critical for the development of executive functions in children.	631	NA	631	- 528 (children), 103 (adults)	12	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filter)	no			#NAAM?

Task-induced subjective fatigue and resting-state striatal connectivity following traumatic brain injury	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Background: People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience fatigue, but an understanding of the neural underpinnings of fatigue following TBI is still lacking. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine associations between functional connectivity (FC) changes and task induced changes in subjective fatigue in people with moderate-severe TBI. Methods: Sixteen people with moderate-severe TBI and 17 matched healthy controls (HC) performed an adaptive N-back task (working memory task) to induce cognitive fatigue. Before and after the task they rated their state fatigue level and underwent rs-fMRI. Seed-to-voxel analyses with seeds in areas involved in cognitive fatigue, namely the striatum and default mode network (DMN) including, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, were performed Results: The adaptive N-back task was effective in inducing fatigue in both groups. Subjective task-induced fatigue was positively associated with FC between striatum and precuneus in people with TBI, while there was a negative association in HC. In contrast, subjective task-induced fatigue was negatively associated with FC between striatum and cerebellum in the TBI group, while there was no association in HC. Similar associations between task-induced subjective fatigue and DMN FC were found across the groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the subjective experience of fatigue was linked to DMN connectivity in both groups and was differently associated with striatal connectivity in people with moderate-severe TBI compared to HC. Defining fatigue-induced neuronal network changes is pertinent to the development of treatments that target abnormal neuronal activity after TBI.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		seed to voxel

Cellular Substrates of Functional Network Integration and Memory in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients are at risk of memory deficits, which have been linked to functional network disturbances, particularly of integration of the default mode network (DMN). However, the cellular substrates of functional network integration are unknown. We leverage a unique cross-scale dataset of drug-resistant TLE patients (n = 31), who underwent pseudo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or neuropsychological testing before neurosurgery. fMRI and MEG underwent atlas-based connectivity analyses. Functional network centrality of the lateral middle temporal gyrus, part of the DMN, was used as a measure of local network integration. Subsequently, non-pathological cortical tissue from this region was used for single cell morphological and electrophysiological patch-clamp analysis, assessing integration in terms of total dendritic length and action potential rise speed. As could be hypothesized, greater network centrality related to better memory performance. Moreover, greater network centrality correlated with more integrative properties at the cellular level across patients. We conclude that individual differences in cognitively relevant functional network integration of a DMN region are mirrored by differences in cellular integrative properties of this region in TLE patients. These findings connect previously separate scales of investigation, increasing translational insight into focal pathology and large-scale network disturbances in TLE.	31	31	NA	NA	72	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (minimum spanning tree)	yes (absolutised)	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filter)	no			#NAAM?

The effect of learning to drum on behavior and brain function in autistic adolescents	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF        AMERICA	This current study aimed to investigate the impact of drum training on behavior and brain function in autistic adolescents with no prior drumming experience. Thirty-six autistic adolescents were recruited and randomly assigned to one of two groups. The drum group received individual drum tuition (two lessons per week over an 8-wk period), while the control group did not. All participants attended a testing session before and after the 8-wk period. Each session included a drumming assessment, an MRI scan, and a parent completing questionnaires relating to the participants' behavioral difficulties. Results showed that improvements in drumming performance were associated with a significant reduction in hyperactivity and inattention difficulties in drummers compared to controls. The fMRI results demonstrated increased functional connectivity in brain areas responsible for inhibitory control, action outcomes monitoring, and self-regulation. In particular, seed-to-voxel analyses revealed an increased functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. A multivariate pattern analysis demonstrated significant changes in the medial frontal cortex, the left and right paracingulate cortex, the subcallosal cortex, the left frontal pole, the caudate, and the left nucleus accumbens. In conclusion, this study investigates the impact of a drum-based intervention on neural and behavioral outcomes in autistic adolescents. We hope that these findings will inform further research and trials into the potential use of drum-based interventions in benefitting clinical populations with inhibition-related disorders and emotional and behavioral difficulties.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Increased ventral striatal functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia during reward anticipation	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Background: Growing evidence points towards dysfunction of the ventral striatum as a neural substrate of motivational impairments in schizophrenia. Ventral striatal activity during reward anticipation is generally reduced in patients with schizophrenia and specifically correlates with apathy. However, little is known about the cortico-striatal functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia during reward anticipation and its relation to negative symptoms. Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify categorical group differences in ventral striatal functional connectivity during reward anticipation between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, and dimensional associations between cortico-striatal functional connectivity and negative symptom severity. Method: A total of 40 patients with schizophrenia (10 females) and 33 healthy controls (8 females) were included from two previously published studies. All participants performed a variant of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task while undergoing event-related fMRI. Functional connectivity was assessed using psychophysical interactions (PPI) with the left and right ventral striatum as seeds and the contrast [High Reward Anticipation - No Reward Anticipation]. Negative symptoms were assessed using the Brief Negative Symptom Scale. Results: Compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia showed increased functional connectivity between the left ventral striatum and the left precuneus and right parahippocampal gyrus, two hubs of the default mode network (cluster-level threshold: FWE, p < .05). In addition, we found a negative association between apathy scores on the BNSS and increased functional connectivity between the left ventral striatum and the left ventral anterior insula / putamen and the left inferior frontal gyrus / dorsal anterior insula (cluster-level threshold: FWE, p < .05). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the patterns of increased functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and the dorsal default mode network during reward anticipation could act as a compensatory mechanism to regulate the activity of the ventral striatum. Our results also showed that functional connectivity patterns from the ventral striatum, much like its local activity, is specifically related to apathy, and not diminished expression.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

However, the neural underpinnings that explain RP and SFE are still unknown. Method Here, we employed prediction and lesion models to decode resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of RP and SFE for reciprocity decisions of healthy volunteers who underwent RS functional magnetic resonance imaging and completed one-shot trust (give frame) and distrust (take frame) games as trustees. Results Regarding the central core, reciprocity rates were positively associated between the give and take frame. Neuroimaging results showed that inter-network RSFC between the default-mode network (DMN; associated with mentalizing) and cingulo-opercular network (associated with cognitive control) contributed to the prediction of reciprocity under both frames. Regarding the periphery, behavioral results demonstrated a significant framing effect-people reciprocated more in the give than in the take frame. Our neuroimaging results revealed that intra-network RSFC of DMN (associated with mentalizing) contributed dominantly to the prediction of SFE. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence for distinct neural mechanisms of RP and SFE in reciprocity decisions.	88	NA	88	NA	142	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filter)	no			#NAAM?

Twenty-six pure-motor ALS patients and 52 healthy controls underwent RS functional MRI and a neuropsychological assessment including the Comprehensive Affect Testing System. A seed-based RS-FC analysis was performed between the left and right GP and the rest of the brain and compared between groups. Correlations between RS-FC significant changes and subjects' performance in recognizing disgust were tested. Compared to controls, patients were significantly less able to recognize disgust. In ALS compared to controls, the seed-based analysis showed: reduced RS-FC between bilateral GP and bilateral middle and superior frontal and middle cingulate gyri, and increased RS-FC between bilateral GP and bilateral postcentral, supramarginal and superior temporal gyri and Rolandic operculum. Decreased RS-FC was further observed between left GP and left middle and inferior temporal gyri and bilateral caudate; and increased RS-FC was also shown between right GP and left lingual and fusiform gyri. In patients and controls, lower performance in recognizing disgust correlated with reduced RS-FC between left GP and left middle and inferior temporal gyri. In pure-motor ALS patients, we demonstrated altered RS-FC between GP and the rest of the brain. The reduced left pallidum-temporo-striatal RS-FC may have a role in the lower ability of patients in recognizing disgust.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- seed based with two seeds  - seems like the network construction was automated: ""Seed-based RS-FC was then performed using a 2-step regression analysis as implemented in the FMRIB software library (FSLv5)"" - ""The output of this step is represented by subject-level maps of all positively and negatively predicted voxels for each regressor.""

Twenty participants performed a complex cognitive task in either safe or aversive conditions. Our results showed that increased mental workload induced recruitment of the lateral frontoparietal executive control network (ECN), along with disengagement of medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate regions of the default mode network (DMN). Mental workload also elicited an increase in heart rate and pupil diameter. Task performance did not decrease under the threat of stressors, most likely due to efficient inhibition of auditory regions, as reflected by a large decrement of activity in the superior temporal gyri. The threat of stressors was also accompanied with deactivations of limbic regions of the salience network (SN), possibly reflecting emotional regulation mechanisms through control from dorsal medial prefrontal and parietal regions, as indicated by functional connectivity analyses. Meanwhile, the threat of stressors induced enhanced ECN activity, likely for improved attentional and cognitive processes toward the task, as suggested by increased lateral prefrontal and parietal activations. These fMRI results suggest that measuring the balance between ECN, SN, and DMN recruitment could be used for objective mental state assessment. In this sense, an extra recruitment of task-related regions and a high ratio of lateral versus medial prefrontal activity may represent a relevant marker of increased but efficient mental effort, while the opposite may indicate a disengagement from the task due to mental overload and/or stressors.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		- wrong outcome (task activity) - they say they analyse connectivity but I could not find correlation, weights, theresholds, nodes, inclusion strategy, seems like they use the SPM CONN toolbox to do the analysis

However, multiple confounding factors may impact the predicted brain-behavior relationships. In this study, we investigated the impact of 4 confounding factors including time series length, functional connectivity (FC) type, brain parcellation choice, and variance of the predicted target. The data from Human Connectome Project including 1,206 healthy subjects were employed, with 3 cognitive traits including fluid intelligence, working memory, and picture vocabulary ability as the prediction targets. We compared the prediction performance under different settings of these 4 factors using partial least square regression. Results demonstrated appropriate time series length (300 time points) and brain parcellation (independent component analysis, ICA100/200) can achieve better prediction performance without too much time consumption. FC calculated by Pearson, Spearman, and Partial correlation achieves higher accuracy and lower time cost than mutual information and coherence. Cognitive traits with larger variance among subjects can be better predicted due to the well elaboration of individual variability. In addition, the beneficial effects of increasing scan duration to prediction partially arise from the improved test-retest reliability of RSFC. Taken together, the study highlights the importance of determining these factors in RSFC-based prediction, which can facilitate standardization of RSFC-based prediction pipelines going forward.	1003	NA	1003	NA	115	NA	multiple	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, length of timseries), physiological (ICA-FIX), clinical/psychological (variance of cognitive scores), other (functional connectivity type, nr of ICs used in group ICA for brain parcellation)	no			- association types: full correlation, partial correlation, coherence, mutual information (time domain) - network sizes: 15/25/50/100/200/300 ICs, average taken for network size  - no mention of inclusion strategy			so can be included but they did not use correlation, but permutation entropy, so the thresholding and weighting is not applicable in this instance I think.

Number sense in early childhood is predictive of academic and professional success, and deficits in number sense are thought to underlie lifelong impairments in mathematical abilities. Despite its importance, the brain circuit mechanisms that support number sense learning remain poorly understood. Here, we designed a theoretically motivated training program to determine brain circuit mechanisms underlying foundational number sense learning in female and male elementary school-age children (7-10 years). Our 4 week integrative number sense training program gradually strengthened the understanding of the relations between symbolic (Arabic numerals) and nonsymbolic (sets of items) representations of quantity. We found that our number sense training program improved symbolic quantity discrimination ability in children across a wide range of math abilities including children with learning difficulties. Crucially, the strength of pretraining functional connectivity between the hippocampus and intraparietal sulcus, brain regions implicated in associative learning and quantity discrimination, respectively, predicted individual differences in number sense learning across typically developing children and children with learning difficulties. Reverse meta-analysis of interregional coactivations across 14,371 fMRI studies and 89 cognitive functions confirmed a reliable role for hippocampal-intraparietal sulcus circuits in learning. Our study identifies a canonical hippocampal-parietal circuit for learning that plays a foundational role in children's cognitive skill acquisition. Findings provide important insights into neurobiological circuit markers of individual differences in children's learning and delineate a robust target for effective cognitive interventions.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based

A direct test of competitive versus cooperative episodic-procedural network dynamics in human memory	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Classical lesion studies led to a consensus that episodic and procedural memory arises from segregated networks identified with the hippocampus and the caudate nucleus, respectively. Neuroimaging studies, however, show that competitive and cooperative interactions occur between networks during memory tasks. Furthermore, causal experiments to manipulate connectivity between these networks have not been performed in humans. Although nodes common to both networks, such as the precuneus and ventrolateral thalamus, may mediate their interaction, there is no experimental evidence for this. We tested how network-targeted noninvasive brain stimulation affects episodic-procedural network interactions and how these network manipulations affect episodic and procedural memory in healthy young adults. Compared to control (vertex) stimulation, hippocampal network-targeted stimulation increased within-network functional connectivity and hippocampal connectivity with the caudate. It also increased episodic, relative to procedural, memory, and this persisted one week later. The differential effect on episodic versus procedural memory was associated with increased functional connectivity between the caudate, precuneus, and ventrolateral thalamus. These findings provide direct evidence of episodic-procedural network competition, mediated by regions common to both networks. Enhanced hippocampal network connectivity may boost episodic, but decrease procedural, memory by co-opting resources shared between networks.	41	NA	NA	NA	54	NA	regression	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filtering)	no

Individualized Functional Subnetworks Connect Human Striatum and Frontal Cortex	CEREBRAL CORTEX	The striatum and cerebral cortex are interconnected via multiple recurrent loops that play a major role in many neuropsychiatric conditions. Primate corticostriatal connections can be precisely mapped using invasive tract-tracing. However, noninvasive human research has not mapped these connections with anatomical precision, limited in part by the practice of averaging neuroimaging data across individuals. Here we utilized highly sampled resting-state functional connectivity MRI for individual-specific precision functional mapping (PFM) of corticostriatal connections. We identified ten individual-specific subnetworks linking cortex-predominately frontal cortex-to striatum, most of which converged with nonhuman primate tract-tracing work. These included separable connections between nucleus accumbens core/shell and orbitofrontal/medial frontal gyrus; between anterior striatum and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; between dorsal caudate and lateral prefrontal cortex; and between middle/posterior putamen and supplementary motor/primary motor cortex. Two subnetworks that did not converge with nonhuman primates were connected to cortical regions associated with human language function. Thus, precision subnetworks identify detailed, individual-specific, neurobiologically plausible corticostriatal connectivity that includes human-specific language networks.	10	NA	10	NA	10	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, global signal regression)	no			#NAAM?			it could be seed-based, but indeed very unclear - would exclude based on not enough available information

The human vestibular cortex: functional anatomy of OP2, its connectivity and the effect of vestibular disease	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Area OP2 in the posterior peri-sylvian cortex has been proposed to be the core human vestibular cortex. We investigated the functional anatomy of OP2 and adjacent areas (OP2(+)) using spatially constrained independent component analysis (ICA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project. Ten ICA-derived subregions were identified. OP2(+) responses to vestibular and visual motion were analyzed in 17 controls and 17 right-sided vestibular neuritis patients who had previously undergone caloric and optokinetic stimulation during fMRI. In controls, a posterior part of right OP2(+) showed: (i) direction-selective responses to visual motion and (ii) activation during caloric stimulation that correlated positively with perceived self-motion, and negatively with visual dependence and peak slow-phase nystagmus velocity. Patients showed abnormal OP2(+) activity, with an absence of visual or caloric activation of the healthy ear and no correlations with vertigo or visual dependence-despite normal slow-phase nystagmus responses to caloric stimulation. Activity in a lateral part of right OP2(+) correlated with chronic visually induced dizziness in patients. In summary, distinct functional subregions of right OP2(+) show strong connectivity to other vestibular areas and a profile of caloric and visual responses, suggesting a central role for vestibular function in health and disease.	100	NA	100	NA	21	NA	full correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filter)	no			"- network siz: 21 because 10 components of ROIs were each correlated with 20 regions - ""The whole-brain connectivity map of each independent component of OP2+ was then spatially correlated against 20 whole-brain intrinsic connectivity networks derived from ICA applied to the HCP data"" "

We used a paradigm of virtual obedience to authority, in which an experimenter ordered a volunteer to press a handheld button to initiate actions that carried different consequences, including harming or helping others. In this study, we scanned the brain with functional neuroimaging and applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate the activation of the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) in healthy volunteers in a single-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover trial with anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation. We observed that cathodal stimulation, compared to anodal and sham stimulation, significantly reduced reaction times (RTs) to initiating harming actions. The effect of tDCS on the rTPJ, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex had opposite directions depending on coercive harming or helping actions. Cathodal tDCS-induced changes in the strength of the functional connectivity between the rTPJ and amygdala predicted the effect of cathodal tDCS on harming RTs. The findings provide evidence supporting the rTPJ having a role in coercion-induced changes in the sense of agency. Neuromodulation with tDCS might help in unveiling the power of authority and assisting in the emergence of prosocial behavior, thus shedding light on coping strategies against coercion beyond merely examining its effects.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- PPI but couldn't extract much 		PPI			
Jia, FL and Liu, CY and Tan, LH and Siok, WT and Jia, Fanlu and Liu, Chun Yin and Li Hai Tan and Siok, Wai Ting	Lifespan developmental changes in neural substrates and functional connectivity for visual semantic processing	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Human learning and cognitive functions change with age and experience, with late-developed complex cognitive functions, particularly those served by the prefrontal cortex, showing more age-dependent variance. Reading as a complex process of constructing meaning from print uses the left prefrontal cortex and may show a similar aging pattern. In this study, we delineated the lifespan developmental changes in the neural substrates and functional connectivity for visual semantic processing from childhood (age 6) to late adulthood (age 74). Different from previous studies that reported aging as a form of activation or neuronal changes, we examined additionally how the functional connectivity networks changed with age. A cohort of 122 Chinese participants performed semantic and font-size judgment tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although a common left-lateralized neural system including the left mid-inferior prefrontal cortex was recruited across all participants, the effect of age, or reading experience, is evident as 2 contrastive developmental patterns: a declining trend in activation strength and extent and an increasing trend in functional connections of the network. This study suggests that visual semantic processing is not prone to cognitive decline, and that continuous reading until old age helps strengthen the functional connections of reading-related brain regions.	122	NA	122	NA	20	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ART outlier detection, high pass filtering, band-pass filtering) 	no			- unclear about selection and weights  - say they use pearson, but fig 4 refers to partial correlations between ROIs

Lambon	Bipartite functional fractionation within the neural system for social cognition supports the psychological continuity of self versus other	CEREBRAL CORTEX	"Research of social neuroscience establishes that regions in the brain's default-mode network (DN) and semantic network (SN) are engaged by socio-cognitive tasks. Research of the human connectome shows that DN and SN regions are both situated at the transmodal end of a cortical gradient but differ in their loci along this gradient. Here we integrated these 2 bodies of research, used the psychological continuity of self versus other as a ""test-case,"" and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether these 2 networks would encode social concepts differently. We found a robust dissociation between the DN and SN-while both networks contained sufficient information for decoding broad-stroke distinction of social categories, the DN carried more generalizable information for cross-classifying across social distance and emotive valence than did the SN. We also found that the overarching distinction of self versus other was a principal divider of the representational space while social distance was an auxiliary factor (subdivision, nested within the principal dimension), and this representational landscape was more manifested in the DN than in the SN. Taken together, our findings demonstrate how insights from connectome research can benefit social neuroscience and have implications for clarifying the 2 networks' differential contributions to social cognition."														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?

We investigated this issue by characterizing how semantic control regions topographically relate to the default-mode network (associated with memory and abstract cognition) and multiple-demand network (associated with executive control). Topographically, we established that semantic control areas were sandwiched by the default-mode and multi-demand networks, forming an orderly arrangement observed both at the individual and group level. Functionally, semantic control regions exhibited ""hybrid"" responses, fusing generic preferences for cognitively demanding operation (multiple-demand) and for meaningful representations (default-mode) into a domain-specific preference for difficult operation on meaningful representations. When projected onto the principal gradient of human connectome, the neural activity of semantic control showed a robustly dissociable trajectory from visuospatial control, implying different roles in the functional transition from sensation to cognition. We discuss why the hybrid functional profile of semantic control regions might result from their intermediate topographical positions on the cortex."														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- PPI, unclear study 		PPI

The adult CC has been divided into various subregions, and this subdivision is highly consistent with its functional differentiation. However, only a few studies have focused on the function of neonatal CC. The aim of this study was to describe the cingulate segregation and the functional connectivity of each subdivision in full-term neonates (n = 60) based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The neonatal CC was divided into three subregions, and each subregion showed specific connectivity patterns. The anterior cingulate cortex was mainly correlated with brain regions related to the salience (affected) network and default mode network (DMN), the midcingulate cortex was related to motor areas, and the posterior cingulate cortex was coupled with DMN. Moreover, we found that the cingulate subregions showed distinct functional profiles with major brain networks, which were defined using independent component analysis, and exhibited functional lateralization. This study provided new insights into the understanding of the functional specialization of neonatal CC, and these findings may have significant clinical implications, especially in predicting neurological disorder.	60	NA	60	NA	10	NA	full correlation	aggregated	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filter, global signal regression)	no			- no mention of weights or thresholds, but from the figures and text it appearsd they constructed weighted networks.

Although DBS has been shown to restore functional neural circuits of this disorder, the changes in topological organization associated with active DBS of each target remain unknown. To investigate this, we acquired resting-state functional mag-netic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 34 medication-free patients with Parkinson's disease that had DBS electrodes implanted in either the subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus ( n = 17 each), in both ON and OFF DBS states. Sixteen age-matched healthy individuals were used as a control group. We evaluated the regional information processing capacity and transmission efficiency of brain networks with and without stimula-tion, and recorded how stimulation restructured the brain network topology of patients with Parkinson's disease. For both targets, the variation of local efficiency in motor brain regions was significantly correlated ( p < 0.05) with improvement rate of the Uniform Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III scores, with comparable improve-ments in motor function for the two targets. However, non-motor brain regions showed changes in topological organization during active stimulation that were target-specific. Namely, targeting the STN decreased the in-formation transmission of association, limbic and paralimbic regions, including the inferior frontal gyrus angle, insula, temporal pole, superior occipital gyri, and posterior cingulate, as evidenced by the simultaneous decrease of clustering coefficient and local efficiency. GPi-DBS had a similar effect on the caudate and lenticular nuclei, but enhanced information transmission in the cingulate gyrus. These effects were not present in the DBS-OFF state for GPi-DBS, but persisted for STN-DBS. Our results demonstrate that DBS to the STN and GPi induce distinct brain network topology reconstruction patterns, providing innovative theoretical evidence for deciphering the mechanism through which DBS affects disparate targets in the human brain.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

TBPM is impaired in aging, and this decline has been associated with white-matter alterations within the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus. In the present study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from 22 healthy young (26 +/- 5.2 years) and 23 older (63 +/- 6.1 years) participants to investigate how age-related alterations in resting-state functional connectivity are related to TBPM performance, and whether these alterations are associated with the white-matter disruptions we have previously observed with diffusion tensor imaging. Whole-brain analyses revealed lower resting-state functional connectivity in older participants compared with younger ones, which in turn correlated with TBPM performance. These correlations were mainly located in the salience network and the parietal part of the frontoparietal network. Our findings suggest that resting-state functional connectivity alterations contribute to the age-related decline in TBPM.	45	NA	45	22 young + 23 elderly	48	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (band pass filtering)	no			#NAAM?

These perceptual expectations, or predictions, come from our knowledge of the context; however, it is unclear how memory and perceptual systems interact to support the prediction and reactivation of sensory details in cortex. To address this, human participants learned the spatial layout of animals positioned in a cross maze. During fMRI, participants of both sexes navigated between animals to reach a target, and in the process saw a predictable sequence of five animal images. Critically, to isolate activity patterns related to item predictions, rather than bottom-up inputs, one-fourth of trials ended early, with a blank screen presented instead. Using multivariate pattern similarity analysis, we reveal that activity patterns in early visual cortex, posterior medial regions, and the posterior hippocampus showed greater similarity when seeing the same item compared with different items. Further, item effects in posterior hippocampus were specific to the sequence context. Critically, activity patterns associated with seeing an item in visual cortex and posterior medial cortex, were also related to activity patterns when an item was expected, but omitted, suggesting sequence predictions were reinstated in these regions. Finally, multivariate connectivity showed that patterns in the posterior hippocampus at one position in the sequence were related to patterns in early visual cortex and posterior medial cortex at a later position. Together, our results support the idea that hippocampal representations facilitate sensory processing by modulating visual cortical activity in anticipation of expected items.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?		no

While studies have shown how functional networks are altered during different tasks, this work has generally focused on a cross-subject approach, emphasizing features that are common across people. Here we used extended sampling ""precision"" fMRI data to test the extent to which task states generalize across people or are individually specific. We trained classifiers to decode state using functional network data in single-person datasets across 5 diverse task states. Classifiers were then tested on either independent data from the same person or new individuals. Individualized classifiers were able to generalize to new participants. However, classification performance was significantly higher within a person, a pattern consistent across model types, people, tasks, feature subsets, and even for decoding very similar task conditions. Notably, these findings also replicated in a new independent dataset. These results suggest that individual-focused approaches can uncover robust features of brain states, including features obscured in cross-subject analyses. Individual-focused approaches have the potential to deepen our understanding of brain interactions during complex cognition."	8	NA	8	NA	333	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, global signal regression)	no			#NAAM?

Functional connectivity in the dorsal network of the cervical spinal cord is correlated with diffusion tensor imaging indices in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Focal lesions may affect functional connectivity (FC) of the ventral and dorsal networks in the cervical spinal cord of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Resting-state FC can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI) at 3T. This study sought to determine whether alterations in FC may be related to the degree of damage in the normal-appearing tissue. Tissue integrity and FC in the cervical spinal cord were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state fMRI, respectively, in a group of 26 RRMS par-ticipants with high cervical lesion load, low disability, and minimally impaired sensorimotor function, and healthy controls. Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity (RD) were observed in the normal-appearing white matter in the RRMS group relative to controls. Average FC in ventral and dorsal net-works was similar between groups. Significant associations were found between higher FC in the dorsal sensory network and several DTI markers of pathology in the normal-appearing tissue. In the normal-appearing grey matter, dorsal FC was positively correlated with axial diffusivity (AD) (r = 0.46, p = 0.020) and mean diffusivity (MD) (r = 0.43, p = 0.032). In the normal-appearing white matter, dorsal FC was negatively correlated with FA (r =-0.43, p = 0.028) and positively correlated with RD (r = 0.49, p = 0.012), AD (r = 0.42, p = 0.037) and MD (r = 0.53, p = 0.006). These results suggest that increased connectivity, while remaining within the normal range, may represent a compensatory mechanism in response to structural damage in support of preserved sensory function in RRMS.														yes	wrong outcome (acquisition)		#NAAM?

However, its effects on spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations of brain activity are still poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigated the frontopolar tDCS effects on resting-state brain activity and connectivity. Twelve healthy participants were recruited and received anode, cathode, and sham stimulation in a randomized order. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after stimulation. Functional connectivity was calculated to examine tDCS effects within and beyond the frontopolar network. To assess the frequency-dependent changes of brain activity, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was computed in the slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) bands. The results showed anodal tDCS-induced widespread connectivity reduction within and beyond the frontopolar network. Regardless of tDCS polarity, stimulation effect on fALFF was significantly larger in slow-5 band compared with the slow-4. Notably, anodal tDCS-induced connectivity changes were associated with pre-tDCS fALFF in slow-4 band, showing positive correlations in the frontal regions and negative correlations in the temporal regions. Our findings imply that tDCS-induced brain alterations may be frequency-dependent, and pre-tDCS regional brain activity could be used to predict post-tDCS connectivity changes.	12	NA	12	NA	90	NA	correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression) 	no			#NAAM?

To this aim, we investigated brain structural and functional differences in high-level fencers compared with nonathlete controls and the MRI substrates of interlimb coordination in elite athletes. Fourteen right-handed male fencers (median age = 22.3 years) and 15 right-handed age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (median age = 22.4 years) underwent structural and functional MRI acquisition during the execution of cyclic bimanual-movements as well as during in-phase and antiphase hand/foot-movements of the dominant-right limbs. No between-group differences were found in gray matter volumes and white matter architecture. Active-fMRI showed that controls versus fencers had higher activations in parietal and temporal areas during bimanual-task; whereas fencers versus controls had higher activations in the basal ganglia. During in-phase task, controls versus fencers showed higher activation of right cerebellum, whereas fencers had higher activity mainly in frontal areas. The functional-connectivity (FC) analysis showed that fencers versus controls had an increased FC between left motor cortex and fronto-temporal areas as well as bilateral thalami during the different tasks. Intensive and prolonged fencing activity is associated with brain functional changes mainly involving frontal regions related to high-level motor control and planning of complex tasks. These modifications are likely to reflect an optimization of brain networks involved in motor activities, including interlimb coordination tasks, occurring after intensive training.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based

Modulation of hippocampal brain networks produces changes in episodic simulation and divergent thinking. 2020a. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 117:12729-12740). Here, we examine if functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-guided TMS disrupts the gradient organization of temporal signal properties, known as the temporal organization, in the hippocampus (HPC) and entorhinal cortex (ERC). For each of 2 TMS sessions, TMS was applied to either a control site (vertex) or to a left AG target region (N = 18; 14 females). Behavioral measures were then administered, and resting-state scans were acquired. Temporal dynamics were measured by tracking change in the fMRI signal (i) ""within"" single voxels over time, termed single-voxel autocorrelation and (ii) ""between"" different voxels over time, termed intervoxel similarity. TMS reduced AG connectivity with the hippocampal target and induced more rapid shifting of activity in single voxels between successive time points, lowering the single-voxel autocorrelation, within the left anteromedial HPC and posteromedial ERC. Intervoxel similarity was only marginally affected by TMS. Our findings suggest that hippocampal-targeted TMS disrupts the functional properties of the target site along the anterior/posterior axis. Further studies should examine the consequences of altering the temporal dynamics of these medial temporal areas to the successful processing of episodic information under task demand."														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Characterization of resting functional MRI activity alterations across epileptic foci and networks	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Brain network alterations have been studied extensively in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) and other focal epilepsies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, little has been done to characterize the basic fMRI signal alterations caused by focal epilepsy. Here, we characterize how mTLE affects the fMRI signal in epileptic foci and networks. Resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI were collected from 47 unilateral mTLE patients and 96 healthy controls. FMRI activity, quantified by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, was increased in the epileptic focus and connected regions in mTLE. Evidence for spread of this epileptic fMRI activity was found through linear relationships of regional activity across subjects, the association of these relationships with functional connectivity, and increased activity along white matter tracts. These fMRI activity increases were found to be dependent on the epileptic focus, where the activity was related to disease severity, suggesting the focus to be the origin of these pathological alterations. Furthermore, we found fMRI activity decreases in the default mode network of right mTLE patients with different properties than the activity increases found in the epileptic focus. This work provides insights into basic fMRI signal alterations and their potential spread across networks in focal epilepsy.	143	47	96	NA	26	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression) 	no			- nodes: also mention 107 ROIs but don't use them for connectivity matrix  - no mention of selection

Functional Connectivity for the Language Network in the Developing Brain: 30 Weeks of Gestation to 30 Months of Age	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Although the neural scaffolding for language is putatively present before birth, the maturation of functional connections among the key nodes of the language network, Broca's and Wernicke's areas, is less known. We leveraged longitudinal and cross-sectional data from three sites collected through six studies to track the development of functional circuits between Broca's and Wernicke's areas from 30 weeks of gestation through 30 months of age in 127 unique participants. Using resting-state fMRI data, functional connectivity was calculated as the correlation between fMRI time courses from pairs of regions, defined as Broca's and Wernicke's in both hemispheres. The primary analysis evaluated 23 individuals longitudinally imaged from 30 weeks postmenstrual age (fetal) through the first postnatal month (neonatal). A secondary analysis in 127 individuals extended these curves into older infants and toddlers. These data demonstrated significant growth of interhemispheric connections including left Broca's and its homolog and left Wernicke's and its homolog from 30 weeks of gestation through the first postnatal month. In contrast, intrahemispheric connections did not show significant increases across this period. These data represent an important baseline for language systems in the developing brain against which to compare those neurobehavioral disorders with the potential fetal onset of disease.	150	NA	NA	23 (prenatal to infant) + 127 extended further into infancy	4	NA	correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression)	no			#NAAM?

In this work, we propose a novel manifold-based geometric neural network for functional brain networks (called ""Geo-Net4Net"" for short) to learn the intrinsic low-dimensional feature representations of resting-state brain networks on the Riemannian manifold. This tool allows us to answer the scientific question of how the spontaneous fluctuation of FC supports behavior and cognition. We deploy a set of positive maps and rectified linear unit (ReLU) layers to uncover the intrinsic low-dimensional feature representations of functional brain networks on the Riemannian manifold taking advantage of the symmetric positive-definite (SPD) form of the correlation matrices. Due to the lack of well-defined ground truth in the resting state, existing learning-based methods are limited to unsupervised methodologies. To go beyond this boundary, we propose to self-supervise the feature representation learning of resting-state functional networks by leveraging the task-based counterparts occurring before and after the underlying resting state. With this extra heuristic, our Geo-Net4Net allows us to establish a more reasonable understanding of resting-state FCs by capturing the geometric patterns (aka. spectral/shape signature) associated with resting states on the Riemannian manifold. We have conducted extensive experiments on both simulated data and task-based functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database, where our Geo-Net4Net not only achieves more accurate change detection results than other state-of-the-art counterpart methods but also yields ubiquitous geometric patterns that manifest putative insights into brain function."														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- unclear if network was constructed  - complicated methodology paper - network size: ""We further estimate the detection accuracy as we increase network size from 10 x 10 to 100 x 100."" network sizes of 10 and 100 averaged for network size column"	Dynamic connectivity (wrong outcome/analysis- exclude): sliding window approach used to construct functional connectivity trajectories during an fMRI task.

Medial Temporal Lobe Networks in Alzheimer's Disease: Structural and Molecular Vulnerabilities	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is connected to the rest of the brain through two main networks: the anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM) systems. Given the crucial role of the MTL and networks in the physiopathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the present study aimed at (1) investigating whether MTL atrophy pmpagates specifically within the AT and PM networks, and (2) evaluating the vulnerability of these networks to AD pmteinopathies. To do that, we used neuroimaging data acquired in human male and female in three distinct cohorts: (1) resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from the aging brain cohort (ABC) to define the AT and PM networks (n=68); (2) longitudinal structural MRI from Alzheimer's diseaw neuroimaging initiative (ADNI)GO/2 to highlight structural covariance patterns (n = 349); and (3) positron emission tomography (PET) data from ADN13 to evaluate the networks' vulnerability to amyloid and tau (n=186). Our results suggest that the atrophy of distinct MTL subregions propagates within the AT and PM networks in a dissociable manner. Brodmann area (BA)35 stnicturally covaried within the AT network while the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) covaried within the PM network. In addition, these networks are differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, with higher tau levels in AT than in PM and higher amyloid levels in PM than in AT. our results also suggest differences in the relative burden of tau species. The current results provide further support for the notion that two distinct MTL networks display differential alterations in the context of AD. These findings have important implications for disease spread and the cognitive manifestations of AD.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

It has been associated with a variable cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric phenotype, but little is known about its effects on brain function. We therefore conducted 7 T resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and compared data of 19 adult individuals with 47,XXX and 21 age-matched healthy control women using independent component analysis and dual regression. Additionally, we examined potential relationships between social cognition and social functioning scores, and IQ, and mean functional connectivity values. The 47,XXX group showed significantly increased functional connectivity of the fronto-parietal resting-state network with the right postcentral gyrus. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) variability was not associated with IQ and social cognition and social functioning deficits in the participants with 47,XXX. We thus observed an effect of a supernumerary X chromosome in adult women on fronto-parietal rsFC. These findings provide additional insight into the role of the X chromosome on functional connectivity of the brain. Further research is needed to understand the clinical implications of altered rsFC in 47,XXX.	40	19	21	NA	7	NA	full correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filtering)	no			"- modeling: ""We then applied FSL’s dual regression (Beckmann et al. 2009) to generate subject-specific spatial maps and associated time series derived from the set of spatial maps from the group-average analysis."" - aggregated?

It is one of the most fundamental concepts in psychological science and is crucial for the effective adaption of behavior to varying environmental demands. Changing external task demands have been shown to induce reconfiguration of functional brain networks. However, whether neural reconfiguration between different tasks is associated with intelligence has not yet been investigated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 812 subjects to show that higher scores of general intelligence are related to less brain network reconfiguration between resting state and seven different task states as well as to network reconfiguration between tasks. This association holds for all functional brain networks except the motor system and replicates in two independent samples (n = 138 and n = 184). Our findings suggest that the intrinsic network architecture of individuals with higher intelligence scores is closer to the network architecture as required by various cognitive demands. Multitask brain network reconfiguration may, therefore, represent a neural reflection of the behavioral positive manifold - the essence of the concept of general intelligence. Finally, our results support neural efficiency theories of cognitive ability and reveal insights into human intelligence as an emergent property from a distributed multitask brain network.	812	NA	812	NA	200	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (correlation with behavioral outcomes)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression)	no			#NAAM?

Metabolic and functional connectivity provide unique and complementary insights into cognition-connectome relationships	CEREBRAL CORTEX	A major challenge in current cognitive neuroscience is how functional brain connectivity gives rise to human cognition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) describes brain connectivity based on cerebral oxygenation dynamics (hemodynamic connectivity), whereas [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose functional positron emission tomography (FDG-fPET) describes brain connectivity based on cerebral glucose uptake (metabolic connectivity), each providing a unique characterization of the human brain. How these 2 modalities differ in their contribution to cognition and behavior is unclear. We used simultaneous resting-state FDG-fPET/fMRI to investigate how hemodynamic connectivity and metabolic connectivity relate to cognitive function by applying partial least squares analyses. Results revealed that although for both modalities the frontoparietal anatomical subdivisions related the strongest to cognition, using hemodynamic measures this network expressed executive functioning, episodic memory, and depression, whereas for metabolic measures this network exclusively expressed executive functioning. These findings demonstrate the unique advantages that simultaneous FDG-PET/fMRI has to provide a comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms that underpin cognition and highlights the importance of multimodality imaging in cognitive neuroscience research.	26	NA	NA	NA	82	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering)	no

Reward enhances connectivity between the ventral striatum and the default mode network	NEUROIMAGE	The default mode network (DMN) has been theorized to participate in a range of social, cognitive, and affective functions. Yet, previous accounts do not consider how the DMN contributes to other brain regions depending on psychological context, thus rendering our understanding of DMN function incomplete. We addressed this gap by applying a novel network-based psychophysiological interaction (nPPI) analysis to the reward task within the Human Connectome Project. We first focused on the task-evoked responses of the DMN and other networks involving the prefrontal cortex, including the executive control network (salience network) and the left and right frontoparietal networks. Consistent with a host of prior studies, the DMN exhibited a relative decrease in activation during the task, while the other networks exhibited a relative increase during the task. Next, we used nPPI analyses to assess whether these networks exhibit task-dependent changes in connectivity with other brain regions. Strikingly, we found that the experience of reward enhances task-dependent connectivity between the DMN and the ventral striatum, an effect that was specific to the DMN. Surprisingly, the strength of DMN-VS connectivity was correlated with personality characteristics relating to openness. Taken together, these results advance models of DMN by demonstrating how it contributes to other brain systems during task performance and how those contributions relate to individual differences.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- 4 separate PPIs conducted

Long-range functional connections mirror and link microarchitectural and cognitive hierarchies in the human brain	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Background Higher-order cognition is hypothesized to be implemented via distributed cortical networks that are linked via long-range connections. However, it is unknown how computational advantages of long-range connections reflect cortical microstructure and microcircuitry. Methods We investigated this question by (i) profiling long-range cortical connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cortico-cortical geodesic distance mapping, (ii) assessing how long-range connections reflect local brain microarchitecture, and (iii) examining the microarchitectural similarity of regions connected through long-range connections. Results Analysis of 2 independent datasets indicated that sensory/motor areas had more clustered short-range connections, while transmodal association systems hosted distributed, long-range connections. Meta-analytical decoding suggested that this topographical difference mirrored shifts in cognitive function, from perception/action towards emotional/social processing. Analysis of myelin-sensitive in vivo MRI as well as postmortem histology and transcriptomics datasets established that gradients in functional connectivity distance are paralleled by those present in cortical microarchitecture. Notably, long-range connections were found to link spatially remote regions of association cortex with an unexpectedly similar microarchitecture. Conclusions By mapping covarying topographies of long-range functional connections and cortical microcircuits, the current work provides insights into structure-function relations in human neocortex.	50	NA	50	- validation data set n=200 (HCP)	200	NA	correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX removal of noise components)	no			- edge selection: thesholding - retaining top 10% functional connections per region  - no specification of correlation type  - construct network from 200 parcels, then average the geodesic distance of selected connections to a seed 	Zarah: edge inclusion strategy = thresholding.

Converging evidence suggests that the cerebellum is involved in a wide range of cognitive functions and mental disorders. An important question thus centers on the extent to which cerebellar function can be linked to transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology. To address this question, we used a multivariate data-driven statistical technique (partial least squares) to identify latent dimensions linking human cerebellar connectome as assessed by functional MRI to a large set of clinical, cognitive, and trait measures across 198 participants, including healthy controls (n = 92) as well as patients diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 35), bipolar disorder (n = 36), and schizophrenia (n = 35). Macroscale spatial gradients of connectivity at voxel level were used to characterize cerebellar connectome properties, which provide a low-dimensional representation of cerebellar connectivity, i.e., a sensorimotor-supramodal hierarchical organization. This multivariate analysis revealed significant correlated patterns of cerebellar connectivity gradients and behavioral measures that could be represented into four latent dimensions: general psychopathology, impulsivity and mood, internalizing symptoms and executive dysfunction. Each dimension was associated with a unique spatial pattern of cerebellar connectivity gradients across all participants. Multiple control analyses and 10-fold cross-validation confirmed the robustness and generalizability of the yielded four dimensions. These findings highlight the relevance of cerebellar connectivity as a necessity for the study and classification of transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology and call on researcher to pay more attention to the role of cerebellum in the dimensions of psychopathology, not just within the cerebral cortex.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- not much information on concepts  - unclear if gradients are also networks and if so there is no information on how they were built  - ""We used diffusion map embedding (Coifman et al., 2005) to identify a low-dimensional embedding gradient from a high-dimensional intracerebellar cortex connectivity matrix for each participant.

In other words, this data-driven analysis results in connectivity gradients that provide a description of the connectome where each voxel is located along a gradient according to its connec tivity pattern. Gradient values represent information about the spatial pattern in the embedding space—shifts in value are not meaningful in terms of “higher” or “lower” scores, but rather reflect changes in relative similarity within a latent dimension, i.e., the similarity of functional connectivity patterns along each dimension (“gradient”).

However, tracking plasticity of naturalistic behavior and associated brain modulations is challenging. Here, we tackled this question implementing a prism adaptation-like training in virtual reality (VRPA) in combination with functional neuroimaging. Three groups of healthy participants (N = 45) underwent VRPA (with a shift either to the left/right side, or with no shift), and performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions before and after training. To capture modulations in free-flowing, task-free brain activity, the fMRI sessions included resting-state and free-viewing of naturalistic videos. We found significant decreases in spontaneous functional connectivity between attentional and default mode (DMN)/fronto-parietal networks, only for the adaptation groups, more pronouncedly in the hemisphere contralateral to the induced shift. In addition, VRPA was found to bias visual responses to naturalistic videos: Following rightward adaptation, we found upregulation of visual response in an area in the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) only in the right hemisphere. Notably, the extent of POS upregulation correlated with the size of the VRPA-induced after-effect measured in behavioral tests. This study demonstrates that a brief VRPA exposure can change large-scale cortical connectivity and correspondingly bias visual responses to naturalistic sensory inputs.	14	NA	NA	56 participants but only 14 for fMRI	96	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (high-pass filtering)	no

Here, we contribute to this framework by examining how OT modulates social brain network correlations during resting and task states, using fMRI. First, we investigated network activation, followed by an analysis of the relationships between networks and individual differences. Subsequently, we evaluated the functional connectivity in both states. Finally, the relationship between networks across states was represented by the predictive power of networks in the resting state for task-evoked activities. The differences in the predicted accuracy between the subjects displayed individual variations in this relationship. Our results showed that the activity of the dorsal default mode network in the resting state had the largest predictive power for task-evoked activation of the precuneus network (PN) only in the OT group. The results also demonstrated that OT reduced the individual variation in PN in the prediction process. These findings suggest a distributed but modulatory effect of OT on the association between resting and task-dependent brain networks.	59	NA	NA	NA	13	NA	full correlation	aggregated	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering)	no			- no explicit mention of network size, only figure 3

Predicting the responsiveness of different patients to acupuncture treatment based on the objective biomarkers would assist physicians to identify the candidates for acupuncture therapy. One hundred FD patients were enrolled, and their clinical characteristics and functional brain MRI data were collected before and after treatment. Taking the pre-treatment functional brain network as features, we constructed the support vector machine models to predict the responsiveness of FD patients to acupuncture treatment. These features contributing critically to the accurate prediction were identified, and the longitudinal analyses of these features were performed on acupuncture responders and non-responders. Results demonstrated that prediction models achieved an accuracy of 0.76 +/- 0.03 in predicting acupuncture responders and non-responders, and a R-2 of 0.24 +/- 0.02 in predicting dyspeptic symptoms relief. Thirty-eight functional brain network features associated with the orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, hippocampus, and anterior insula were identified as the critical predictive features. Changes in these predictive features were more pronounced in responders than in non-responders. In conclusion, this study provided a promising approach to predicting acupuncture efficacy for FD patients and is expected to facilitate the optimization of personalized acupuncture treatment plans for FD.	100	100	NA	NA	35	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression)	no			"- nodes are 35 identified components (supplement) - modelling: ""In order to identify the network nodes and construct the individual-level functional brain network, the independent component analysis (ICA) was performed."" but in fig 2 c) groups are compared  - weights: also fig 2 d) but not very clear "

Behavioral deficits may provide clues to the underlying neurological impairments. Children with ADHD exhibit a larger attentional blink (AB) deficit in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks than typically developing children, so we examined whether brain connectivity in the neural network associated with AB can predict ADHD symptoms and thus serve as potential biomarkers of the underlying neuropathology. We first employed a connectome-based predictive model analysis of adult resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to identify a distributed brain network for AB. The summed functional connectivity (FC) strength within the AB network reliably predicted individual differences in AB magnitude measured by a classical dual-target RSVP task. Furthermore, the summed FC strength within the AB network predicted individual differences in ADHD Rating Scale scores from an independent dataset of pediatric patients. Our findings suggest that the individual AB network could serve as an applicable neuroimaging-based biomarker of AB deficit and ADHD symptoms.	63	NA	63	primary dataset : 63 ADHD dataset :79 (network was constructed and then used for prediction)	218	8	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, global signal regression (only in one of the samples))	no			"- networks were constructed from 218 nodes then grouped into 8 macroregions  - original FC matrices do not contain selection but the ""positive"" / ""negative"" networks do  - they use the FC as input for constructing AB CPM networks but not sure whether that is still relevant for us "	"Zarah: for the primary analysis, no edge inclusion strategy was applied when creating the connectivity matrices.

We present a randomized, triple-blind, sham-controlled, clinical trial to determine the neural substrates of tDCS effects on drug craving. Sixty participants with methamphetamine use disorder were assigned to two groups: active tDCS (5 x 7 cm(2), 2 mA, 20 min, anode/cathode over the F4/Fp1) and sham stimulation. Neuroimaging data of a methamphetamine cue reactivity task were collected immediately before and after stimulation. There was a significant reduction in self-reported craving after stimulation without any significant effect of time-by-group interaction. Our whole-brain analysis demonstrated that there was a global decrease in brain reactivity to cues following sham but not active tDCS. There were significant time-by-group interactions in five main clusters in middle and inferior frontal gyri, anterior insula, inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus with higher activations after active stimulation. There was a significant effect of stimulation type in the relationship between electrical current at the individual level and changes in task-modulated activation. Brain regions with the highest electric current in the prefrontal cortex showed a significant time-by-group interaction in task-modulated connectivity in the frontoparietal network. In this trial, there was no significant effect of the one session of active-F4/Fp1 tDCS on drug craving self-report compared to sham stimulation. However, activation and connectivity differences induced by active compared to sham stimulation suggested some potential mechanisms of tDCS to modulate neural response to drug cues.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- do not specify correlation matrix but network seems to have been created (see 2.7 | Task-modulated functional connectivity analysis) - rs fmri is used to analyse task modulated FC   - is task-modulated FC same as task based? exclude?

Zhao, HC and Turel, O and Bechara, A and He, QH and Zhao, Haichao and Turel, Ofir and Bechara, Antoine and He, Qinghua	How distinct functional insular subdivisions mediate interacting neurocognitive systems	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Recent neurocognitive models propose that the insula serves as a hub of interoceptive awareness system, modulating 2 interplaying neurocognitive systems: The posterior insula (PI) receives and integrates various interoceptive signals; these signals are then transmitted to the anterior insula for processing higher-order representations into awareness, where the dorsal anterior insula (dAI) modulates the prefrontal self-control system and the ventral anterior insula (vAI) modulates the amygdala (AMG)-striatal reward-seeking circuit. We sought to test this view using a multimodal approach. We first used a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach with a sample of 120 undergraduate students. Then, we unpacked the neuro-cognitive association between insular connectivity and cognitive performance during an Iowa gambling fMRI task. Lastly, an independent Open Southwest University Longitudinal Imaging Multimodal dataset was used to validate the results. Findings suggested that the dAI was predominantly connected to the prefrontal regions; the vAI was primarily connected to the AMG-ventral-striatum system; and the PI was mainly connected to the visceral-sensorimotor system. Moreover, cognitive scores were positively correlated with FC between dAI and the self-control process of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and were negatively correlated with FC between vAI and the reward-seeking process of orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. The findings highlight the roles of our theorized subinsular functionality in the overall operation of the neural cognitive systems.	120	NA	120	- 120 resting state - 37 for task experiment	23	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (high-pass filtering)	no			#NAAM?

Neurostimulation techniques have emerged as potential treatments for brain disorders and to improve cognitive functions. Nevertheless, given the ethical restrictions of neurostimulation approaches, in silico perturbation protocols based on causal whole-brain models are fundamental to gaining a mechanistic understanding of brain dynamics. Furthermore, this strategy could serve to identify neurophysiological biomarkers differentiating between age groups through an exhaustive exploration of the global effect of all possible local perturbations. Here, we used a resting-state fMRI dataset divided into middle-aged (N =310, <65 years) and older adults (N =310, >= 65) to characterize brain states in each group as a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space. We showed that the older group exhibited a reduced capability to access a metastable substate that overlaps with the rich club. Then, we fitted the PMS to a whole-brain model and applied in silico stimulations in each node to force transitions from the brain states of the older- to the middle-aged group. We found that the precuneus was the best stimulation target. Overall, these findings could have important implications for designing neurostimulation interventions for reversing the effects of aging on whole-brain dynamics.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

We hypothesized that tinnitus patients with different outcomes after sound therapy (narrowband noise) would have distinct brain network topological alterations. Diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were prospectively performed in 60 patients with idiopathic tinnitus and 57 healthy controls (HCs). Graph-theoretical network analyses of structural connectivity (SC), functional connectivity (FC), and SC and FC coupling were performed. Associations between clinical performance and graph-theoretical features were also analyzed. Treatment was effective (effective group; EG) in 28 patients and ineffective (ineffective group; IG) in 32 patients. For FC, the patients in the EG showed higher local efficiency than patients in the IG. For SC, patients in both the EG and IG displayed lower normalized characteristic path length, characteristic path length, and global efficiency than the HCs. More importantly, patients in the IG had higher coupling than the HCs, whereas there was no difference in coupling between patients in the EG and HCs. Additionally, there were significant associations between the SC features and clinical performance in patients in the EG. Our findings demonstrate that tinnitus patients exhibited significant brain network topological alterations, especially in the structural brain network. More importantly, patients who demonstrated different curative effects showed distinct SC-FC topological coupling properties. SC-FC coupling could be an indicator that could be used to predict prognoses in patients with idiopathic tinnitus before sound therapy.	117	60	57	NA	246	NA	full correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression) 	no

Recently, advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has made it possible to investigate the ascending arousal network (AAN) in vivo. However, the role of AAN in the neuropathology of human insomnia remains unclear. Our study aimed to explore alterations in AAN and its connections with cortical networks in chronic insomnia disorder (CID). Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 60 patients with CID and 60 good sleeper controls (GSCs). Changes in the brain's functional connectivity (FC) between the AAN and eight cortical networks were detected in patients with CID and GSCs. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was employed to differentiate CID patients from GSCs and predict clinical symptoms in patients with CID. Finally, these MVPA findings were further verified using an external data set (32 patients with CID and 33 GSCs). Compared to GSCs, patients with CID exhibited increased FC within the AAN, as well as increased FC between the AAN and default mode, cerebellar, sensorimotor, and dorsal attention networks. These AAN-related FC patterns and the MVPA classification model could be used to differentiate CID patients from GSCs with 88% accuracy in the first cohort and 77% accuracy in the validation cohort. Moreover, the MVPA prediction models could separately predict insomnia (data set 1, R-2 = .34; data set 2, R-2 = .15) and anxiety symptoms (data set 1, R-2 = .35; data set 2, R-2 = .34) in the two independent cohorts of patients. Our findings indicated that AAN contributed to the neurobiological mechanism of insomnia and highlighted that fMRI-based markers and machine learning techniques might facilitate the evaluation of insomnia and its comorbid mental symptoms.	113	57	56	NA	41	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching),  other (education, sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering)	no

Actually, perception of external sensory stimulation requires complex interactions among distributed cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, the interactions among these regions elicited by nociceptive pain remain unclear, which limits our understanding of mechanisms of pain from a brain network perspective. Task fMRI data were collected with a random sequence of intermixed stimuli of four sensory modalities in 80 healthy subjects. Whole-brain psychophysiological interaction analysis was performed to identify task-modulated functional connectivity (FC) patterns for each modality. Task-modulated FC strength and graph-theoretical-based network properties were compared among the four modalities. Lastly, we performed across-sensory-modality prediction analysis based on the whole-brain task-modulated FC patterns to confirm the specific relationship between brain patterns and sensory modalities. For each sensory modality, task-modulated FC patterns were distributed over widespread brain regions beyond those typically activated or deactivated during the stimulation. As compared with the other three sensory modalities, nociceptive stimulation exhibited significantly different patterns (more widespread and stronger FC within the cingulo-opercular network, between cingulo-opercular and sensorimotor networks, between cingulo-opercular and emotional networks, and between default mode and emotional networks) and global property (smaller modularity). Further, a cross-sensory-modality prediction analysis found that task-modulated FC patterns could predict sensory modality at the subject level successfully. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the whole-brain task-modulated FC is preferentially modulated by pain, thus providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of pain processing.	80	NA	80	NA	144	NA	full correlation	individual	both used and not used	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering) 	no	- both with thresholding and without selection (figure 3)?

However, it is not clear yet whether such functional configurations would be able to identify the NCC. We scanned resting-state fMRI data from 21 subjects during wakefulness, propofol-induced sedation, and anesthesia. Graph-theoretical analyses were conducted on awake fMRI data to search for the NCC candidates as brain regions that exhibit both high rich-clubness and high modular variability, which were found to locate in prefrontal and temporoparietal cortices. Another independent data set of 10 highly-sampled subjects was used to validate the NCC distribution at the individual level. Brain module-based dynamic analysis revealed two discrete reoccurring brain states, one of which was dominated by the NCC candidates (state 1), while the other state was predominately composed of primary sensory/motor regions (state 2). Moreover, state 1 appeared to be temporally more stable than state 2, suggesting that the identified NCC members could sustain conscious content as metastable network representations. Finally, we showed that the identified NCC was modulated in terms of functional connectedness and modular variability in response to the loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia. This work offers a framework to search for neural correlates of consciousness by charting the brain network topology and provides new insights into understanding the roles of different regions in underpinning human consciousness.	21	21	NA	NA	246	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering)	no

Ample behavioral and neuroimaging evidence supports the dissociation of the three attention domains. The strong assumption that each attentional system is realized through a separable network, however, raises the question how these networks relate to the intrinsic network structure of the brain. Our understanding of brain networks has advanced majorly in the past years due to the increasing focus on brain connectivity. The brain is intrinsically organized into several large-scale networks whose modular structure persists across task states. Existing proposals on how the presumed attention networks relate to intrinsic networks rely mostly on anecdotal and partly contradictory arguments. We addressed this issue by mapping different attention networks at the level of cifti-grayordinates. Resulting group maps were compared to the group-level topology of 23 intrinsic networks, which we reconstructed from the same participants' resting state fMRI data. We found that all attention domains recruited multiple and partly overlapping intrinsic networks and converged in the dorsal fronto-parietal and midcingulo-insular network. While we observed a preference of each attentional domain for its own set of intrinsic networks, implicated networks did not match well to those proposed in the literature. Our results indicate a necessary refinement of the attention network theory.	86	NA	86	NA	23	NA	full correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression) 	no

M. and Feng, Gangyi	Generalizable predictive modeling of semantic processing ability from functional brain connectivity	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Semantic processing (SP) is one of the critical abilities of humans for representing and manipulating conceptual and meaningful information. Neuroimaging studies of SP typically collapse data from many subjects, but its neural organization and behavioral performance vary between individuals. It is not yet understood whether and how the individual variabilities in neural network organizations contribute to the individual differences in SP behaviors. We aim to identify the neural signatures underlying SP variabilities by analyzing functional connectivity (FC) patterns based on a large-sample Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset and rigorous predictive modeling. We used a two-stage predictive modeling approach to build an internally cross-validated model and to test the model's generalizability with unseen data from different HCP samples and other out-of-sample datasets. FC patterns within a putative semantic brain network were significantly predictive of individual SP scores summarized from five SP-related behavioral tests. This cross-validated model can be used to predict unseen HCP data. The model generalizability was enhanced in the language task compared with other tasks used during scanning and was better for females than males. The model constructed from the HCP dataset can be partially generalized to two independent cohorts that participated in different semantic tasks. FCs connecting to the Perisylvian language network show the most reliable contributions to predictive modeling and the out-of-sample generalization. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural sources of individual differences in SP, which potentially lay the foundation for personalized education for healthy individuals and intervention for SP and language deficits patients.	868	NA	868	- additional testing datasets: 26 (SLD) + 26 (ASC)	60	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (nuisance covariate regression, band pass filtering)	no			#NAAM?

Static and treatment-responsive brain biomarkers of depression relapse vulnerability following prophylactic psychotherapy: Evidence from a randomized control trial	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Background: Neural reactivity to dysphoric mood induction indexes the tendency for distress to promote cognitive reactivity and sensory avoidance. Linking these responses to illness prognosis following recovery from Major Depressive Disorder informs our understanding of depression vulnerability and provides engagement targets for prophylactic interventions. Methods: A prospective fMRI neuroimaging design investigated the relationship between dysphoric reactivity and relapse following prophylactic intervention. Remitted depressed outpatients (N = 85) were randomized to 8 weeks of Cognitive Therapy with a Well-Being focus or Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy. Participants were assessed before and after therapy and followed for 2 years to assess relapse status. Neural reactivity common to both assessment points identified static biomarkers of relapse, whereas reactivity change identified dynamic biomarkers. Results: Dysphoric mood induction evoked prefrontal activation and sensory deactivation. Controlling for past episodes, concurrent symptoms and medication status, somatosensory deactivation was associated with depression recurrence in a static pattern that was unaffected by prophylactic treatment, HR 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.14], p < .001. Treatment-related prophylaxis was linked to reduced activation of the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), HR 3.73, 95% CI [1.33, 10.46], p = .013. Contralaterally, the right LPFC showed dysphoriaevoked inhibitory connectivity with the right somatosensory biomarker Conclusions: These findings support a two-factor model of depression relapse vulnerability, in which: enduring patterns of dysphoria-evoked sensory deactivation contribute to episode return, but vulnerability may be mitigated by targeting prefrontal regions responsive to clinical intervention. Emotion regulation during illness remission may be enhanced by reducing prefrontal cognitive processes in favor of sensory representation and integration.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- PPI - no direct answer to several concepts  - on the PPI: ""8.4.

Here, we provide evidence that cortical dynamics in the ultra-slow frequency range (<0.01-0.1 Hz) requires intact cortical-subcortical communication. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at rest, we identify Dynamic Functional States (DFSs), transient but recurrent clusters of cortical and subcortical regions synchronizing at ultra-slow frequencies. We observe that shifts in cortical clusters are temporally coincident with shifts in subcortical clusters, with cortical regions flexibly synchronizing with either limbic regions (hippocampus/amygdala), or subcortical nuclei (thalamus/basal ganglia). Focal lesions induced by stroke, especially those damaging white matter connections between basal ganglia/thalamus and cortex, provoke anomalies in the fraction times, dwell times, and transitions between DFSs, causing a bias toward abnormal network integration. Dynamical anomalies observed 2 weeks after stroke recover in time and contribute to explaining neurological impairment and long-term outcome. Favaretto et al. show that the brain rapidly alternates between transient connectivity patterns, with cortical regions flexibly synchronizing with two groups of subcortical regions, and that this dynamic is abnormal in stroke patients.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?					
Morris, EL and Taylor, SF and Kang, J and Morris, Emily L. and Taylor, Stephan F. and Kang, Jian	On predictability of individual functional connectivity networks from clinical characteristics	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	In recent years, understanding functional brain connectivity has become increasingly important as a scientific tool with potential clinical implications. Statistical methods, such as graphical models and network analysis, have been adopted to construct functional connectivity networks for single subjects. Here we focus on studying the association between functional connectivity networks and clinical characteristics such as psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, we propose a method to examine predictability of functional connectivity networks from clinical characteristics. Our methods can identify salient clinical characteristics predictive of the whole brain network or specific subnetworks. We illustrate our methods on the analysis of fMRI data in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort study, demonstrating clinically meaningful results.	346	346	NA	NA	264	NA	full correlation	multilevel	yes (thresholding)	no	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (respiration/heart rate artifacts removed using band pass filtering)	no			- thresholded to only contain edges present in > 5% of subjects

Nonlinear functional network connectivity in resting functional magnetic resonance imaging data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	"In this work, we focus on explicitly nonlinear relationships in functional networks. We introduce a technique using normalized mutual information (NMI) that calculates the nonlinear relationship between different brain regions. We demonstrate our proposed approach using simulated data and then apply it to a dataset previously studied by Damaraju et al. This resting-state fMRI data included 151 schizophrenia patients and 163 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We first decomposed these data using group independent component analysis (ICA) and yielded 47 functionally relevant intrinsic connectivity networks. Our analysis showed a modularized nonlinear relationship among brain functional networks that was particularly noticeable in the sensory and visual cortex. Interestingly, the modularity appears both meaningful and distinct from that revealed by the linear approach. Group analysis identified significant differences in explicitly nonlinear functional network connectivity (FNC) between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, particularly in the visual cortex, with controls showing more nonlinearity (i.e., higher normalized mutual information between time courses with linear relationships removed) in most cases. Certain domains, including subcortical and auditory, showed relatively less nonlinear FNC (i.e., lower normalized mutual information), whereas links between the visual and other domains showed evidence of substantial nonlinear and modular properties. Overall, these results suggest that quantifying nonlinear dependencies of functional connectivity may provide a complementary and potentially important tool for studying brain function by exposing relevant variation that is typically ignored. Beyond this, we propose a method that captures both linear and nonlinear effects in a ""boosted"" approach. This method increases the sensitivity to group differences compared to the standard linear approach, at the cost of being unable to separate linear and nonlinear effects."	314	151	163	NA	47	NA	multiple	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), scan related (motion)	no			- association type: full correlation, normalised mutual information

A brain region has more than one connection with the superficial cortical areas. The current study proposed a multi-target focused rTMS protocol for indirectly stimulating a deep region, and to investigate 1) whether FC strength between stimulation targets (right middle frontal gyrus [rMFG] and right inferior parietal lobule [rIPL]) and effective region (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC]) can predict local activity changes of dACC and 2) whether multiple stimulation targets can focus on the dACC via FC. A total of 24 healthy participants received rTMS with two stimulation targets, both showing strong FC with the dACC. There were four rTMS conditions (>1 week apart, 10 Hz, 1800 pulses for each): rMFG-target, rIPL-target, Double-targets (900 pulses for each target), and Sham. The results failed to validate the multi-target focused rTMS hypothesis. But rMFG-target significantly decreased the local activity in the dACC. In addition, stronger dACC-rMFG FC was associated with a greater local activity change in the dACC. Future studies should use stronger FC to focus stimulation effects on the deep region.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based

Following RDoC's integrative approach, we aimed to develop brain-based predictive models for cognitive abilities that (a) are developmentally stable over years during adolescence and (b) account for the relationships between cognitive abilities and socio-demographic, psychological and genetic factors. For this, we leveraged the unique power of the large-scale, longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n similar to 11 k) and combined MRI data across modalities (task-fMRI from three tasks: resting-state fMRI, structural MRI and DTI) using machine-learning. Our brain-based, predictive models for cognitive abilities were stable across 2 years during young adolescence and generalisable to different sites, partially predicting childhood cognition at around 20% of the variance. Moreover, our use of `opportunistic stacking' allowed the model to handle missing values, reducing the exclusion from around 80% to around 5% of the data. We found fronto-parietal networks during a working-memory task to drive childhood-cognition prediction. The brain-based, predictive models significantly, albeit partially, accounted for variance in childhood cognition due to (1) key socio-demographic and psychological factors (proportion mediated = 18.65% [17.29%-20.12%]) and (2) genetic variation, as reflected by the polygenic score of cognition (proportion mediated = 15.6% [11%-20.7%]). Thus, our brain-based predictive models for cognitive abilities facilitate the development of a robust, transdiagnostic research tool for cognition at the neural level in keeping with the RDoC's integrative framework.	11758	NA	NA	NA	333	13	multiple	aggregated	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression), other (site)  	no			- 333 parcels assigned to 13 networks  - association type: full correlation, partial correlation

The individual properties of brain networks at rest have been highlighted as a possible source for such biomarkers, with the added advantage that they are relatively straightforward to obtain. However, an important prerequisite for their consideration is their reproducibility. While the reliability of resting-state (RS) measurements has often been studied at standard field strengths, they have rarely been investigated using ultrahigh-field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. We investigated the intersession stability of four functional MRI RS parameters-amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF; representing the spontaneous brain activity), regional homogeneity (ReHo; measure of local connectivity), and degree centrality (DC; measure of long-range connectivity)-in three RS networks, previously shown to play an important role in several psychiatric diseases-the default mode network (DMN), the central executive network (CEN), and the salience network (SN). Our investigation at individual subject space revealed a strong stability for ALFF, ReHo, and DC in all three networks, and a moderate level of stability in fALFF. Furthermore, the internetwork connectivity between each network pair was strongly stable between CEN/SN and moderately stable between DMN/SN and DMN/SN. The high degree of reliability and reproducibility in capturing the properties of the three major RS networks by means of UHF-MRI points to its applicability as a potentially useful tool in the search for disease-relevant biomarkers.	16	NA	16	NA	15	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (nuisance covariate regression) 	no			#NAAM?

However, the molecular substrates underlying such connectivity profiles are unclear. Here, transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial correlation analyses were performed between transcriptomic data from the Allen human brain atlas and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of 24 fine-grained sensorimotor subregions from 793 healthy subjects. Results showed that rsFC of six sensorimotor subregions were associated with expression measures of six gene sets that were specifically expressed in brain tissue. These sensorimotor subregions could be classified into the polygenic- and oligogenic-modulated subregions, whose rsFC were related to gene sets diverging on their numbers (hundreds vs. dozens) and functional characteristics. First, the former were specifically expressed in multiple types of neurons and immune cells, yet the latter were not specifically expressed in any cortical cell types. Second, the former were preferentially expressed during the middle and late stages of cortical development, while the latter showed no preferential expression during any stages. Third, the former were prone to be enriched for general biological functions and pathways, but the latter for specialized biological functions and pathways. Fourth, the former were enriched for neuropsychiatric disorders, whereas this enrichment was absent for the latter. Finally, although the identified genes were commonly associated with sensorimotor behavioral processes, the polygenic-modulated subregions associated genes were additionally related to vision and dementia. These findings may advance our understanding of the functional homogeneity and heterogeneity of the human sensorimotor cortex from the perspective of underlying genetic architecture.	793	NA	793	NA	24	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, signal drift), physiological/biological (band pass filtering) 	no			#NAAM?

Despite several previous attempts to investigate the hierarchical organization of the insula by applying the recently developed gradient approach to insula-to-whole brain connectivity data, little is known about whether and how there is variability across connectivity gradients of the insula to different cerebral systems. Resting-state functional MRI data from 793 healthy subjects were used to discover and validate functional connectivity gradients of the insula, which were computed based on its voxel-wise functional connectivity profiles to distinct cerebral systems. We identified three primary patterns of functional connectivity gradients of the insula to distinct cerebral systems. The connectivity gradients to the higher-order transmodal associative systems, including the prefrontal, posterior parietal, temporal cortices, and limbic lobule, showed a ventroanterior-dorsal axis across the insula; those to the lower-order unimodal primary systems, including the motor, somatosensory, and occipital cortices, displayed radiating transitions from dorsoanterior toward both ventroanterior and dorsoposterior parts of the insula; the connectivity gradient to the subcortical nuclei exhibited an organization along the anterior-posterior axis of the insula. Apart from complementing and extending previous literature on the heterogeneous connectivity patterns of insula subregions, the presented framework may offer ample opportunities to refine our understanding of the role of the insula in many brain disorders.	361	NA	NA	- validation datasets: 103 + 329	965	NA	full correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering) 	no

Neural oscillations track recovery of consciousness in acute traumatic brain injury patients	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Electroencephalography (EEG), easily deployed at the bedside, is an attractive modality for deriving quantitative biomarkers of prognosis and differential diagnosis in severe brain injury and disorders of consciousness (DOC). Prior work by Schiff has identified four dynamic regimes of progressive recovery of consciousness defined by the presence or absence of thalamically-driven EEG oscillations. These four predefined categories (ABCD model) relate, on a theoretical level, to thalamocortical integrity and, on an empirical level, to behavioral outcome in patients with cardiac arrest coma etiologies. However, whether this theory-based stratification of patients might be useful as a diagnostic biomarker in DOC and measurably linked to thalamocortical dysfunction remains unknown. In this work, we relate the reemergence of thalamically-driven EEG oscillations to behavioral recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a cohort of N = 38 acute patients with moderate-to-severe TBI and an average of 1 week of EEG recorded per patient. We analyzed an average of 3.4 hr of EEG per patient, sampled to coincide with 30-min periods of maximal behavioral arousal. Our work tests and supports the ABCD model, showing that it outperforms a data-driven clustering approach and may perform equally well compared to a more parsimonious categorization. Additionally, in a subset of patients (N = 11), we correlated EEG findings with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity between nodes in the mesocircuit-which has been theoretically implicated by Schiff in DOC-and report a trend-level relationship that warrants further investigation in larger studies.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- wrong outcome (analysis) - seed based connectivity analysis but performed using FEAT, so automated?  - could not find any information on the network

Spatial variation of changes in test-retest reliability of functional connectivity after global signal regression: The effect of considering hemodynamic delay	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Global signal regression (GSR) is a controversial analysis method, since its removal of signal has been observed to reduce the reliability of functional connectivity estimates. Here, we used test-retest reliability to characterize potential differences in spatial patterns between conventional, static GSR (sGSR) and a novel dynamic form of GSR (dGSR). In contrast with sGSR, dGSR models the global signal at a time delay to correct for blood arrival time. Thus, dGSR accounts for greater variation in global signal, removes blood-flow-related nuisance signal, and leaves higher quality neuronal signal remaining. We used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to estimate the reliability of functional connectivity in 462 healthy controls from the Human Connectome Project. We tested across two factors: denoising method used (control, sGSR, and dGSR), and interacquisition interval (between days, or within session while varying phase encoding direction). Reliability was estimated regionally to identify topographic patterns for each condition. sGSR and dGSR provided global reductions in reliability compared with the non-GSR control. Test-retest reliability was highest in the frontoparietal and default mode regions, and lowest in sensorimotor cortex for all conditions. dGSR provides more effective denoising in regions where both strategies greatly reduce reliability. Both GSR methods substantially reduced test-retest reliability, which was most evident in brain regions that had low reliability prior to denoising. These findings suggest that reliability of interregional correlation is likely inflated by the global signal, which is thought to primarily reflect dynamic blood flow.	462	NA	462	NA	419	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX removal of noise components, global signal regression)	no			#NAAM?

Studies have focused on how individual concepts are processed, but the way in which conceptual representation changes to suit the context is unclear. We parametrically manipulated the association strength between words, presented in pairs one word at a time using a slow event-related fMRI design. We combined representational similarity analysis and computational linguistics to probe the neurocomputational content of these trials. Individual word meaning was maintained in supramarginal gyrus (associated with verbal short-term memory) when items were judged to be unrelated, but not when a linking context was retrieved. Context-dependent meaning was instead represented in left lateral prefrontal gyrus (associated with controlled retrieval), angular gyrus, and ventral temporal lobe (regions associated with integrative aspects of memory). Analyses of informational connectivity, examining the similarity of activation patterns across trials between sites, showed that control network regions had more similar multivariate responses across trials when association strength was weak, reflecting a common controlled retrieval state when the task required more unusual associations. These findings indicate that semantic control and representational sites amplify contextually relevant meanings in trials judged to be related.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- informational connectivity analysis, exclude?

Xu, LZ and Feng, JF and Yu, LC and Xu, Longzhou and Feng, Jianfeng and Yu, Lianchun	Avalanche criticality in individuals, fluid intelligence, and working memory	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	The critical brain hypothesis suggests that efficient neural computation can be achieved through critical brain dynamics. However, the relationship between human cognitive performance and scale-free brain dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the whole-brain avalanche activity and its individual variability in the human resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We showed that though the group-level analysis was inaccurate because of individual variability, the subject wise scale-free avalanche activity was significantly associated with maximal synchronization entropy of their brain activity. Meanwhile, the complexity of functional connectivity, as well as structure-function coupling, is maximized in subjects with maximal synchronization entropy. We also observed order-disorder phase transitions in resting-state brain dynamics and found that there were longer times spent in the subcritical regime. These results imply that large-scale brain dynamics favor the slightly subcritical regime of phase transition. Finally, we showed evidence that the neural dynamics of human participants with higher fluid intelligence and working memory scores are closer to criticality. We identified brain regions whose critical dynamics showed significant positive correlations with fluid intelligence performance and found that these regions were located in the prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex, which were believed to be important nodes of brain networks underlying human intelligence. Our results reveal the possible role that avalanche criticality plays in cognitive performance and provide a simple method to identify the critical point and map cortical states on a spectrum of neural dynamics, ranging from subcriticality to supercriticality.	284	NA	NA	NA	96	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	no	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression)	no		in additional analysis (dynamic FC?) also took into account age and education.

A meta-analysis of resting-state MRI studies by Gursel et al. (2018) described altered functional connectivity in OCD patients within and between the default mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the frontoparietal network (FPN), as well as evidence for aberrant fronto-striatal circuitry. Here, we tested the replicability of these meta-analytic rsfMRI findings by measuring functional connectivity during resting-state fMRI in a new sample of OCD patients (n = 24) and matched controls (n = 33). We performed seed-to-voxel analyses using 30 seed regions from the prior meta-analysis. OCD patients showed reduced functional connectivity between the SN and the DMN compared to controls, replicating previous findings. We did not observe significant group differences of functional connectivity within the DMN, SN, nor FPN. Additionally, we observed reduced connectivity between the visual network to both the DMN and SN in OCD patients, in particular reduced functional connectivity between lateral parietal seeds and the left inferior lateral occipital pole. Furthermore, the right lateral parietal seed (associated with the DMN) was more strongly correlated with a cluster in the right lateral occipital cortex and precuneus (a region partly overlapping with the Dorsal Attentional Network (DAN)) in patients. Importantly, this latter finding was positively correlated to OCD symptom severity. Overall, our study partly replicated prior meta-analytic findings, highlighting hypoconnectivity between SN and DMN as a potential biomarker for OCD. Furthermore, we identified changes between the SN and the DMN with the visual network. This suggests that abnormal connectivity between cortex regions associated with abstract functions (transmodal regions such as the DMN), and cortex regions associated with constrained neural processing (unimodal regions such as the visual cortex), may be important in OCD.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based

Decreased reward circuit connectivity during reward anticipation in major depression	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	An important symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) is the inability to experience pleasure, possibly due to a dysfunction of the reward system. Despite promising insights regarding impaired reward-related processing in MDD, circuit-level abnormalities remain largely unexplored. Furthermore, whereas studies contrasting experimental conditions from incentive tasks have revealed important information about reward processing, temporal difference modeling of reward -related prediction error (PE) signals might give a more accurate representation of the reward system. We used a monetary incentive delay task during functional MRI scanning to explore PE-related striatal and ventral tegmental area (VTA) activation in response to anticipation and delivery of monetary rewards in 24 individuals with MDD versus 24 healthy controls (HCs). Furthermore, we investigated group differences in temporal difference related connectivity with a generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis with the VTA, ventral striatum (VS) and dorsal striatum (DS) as seeds during reward versus neutral, both in anticipation and delivery. Relative to HCs, MDD patients displayed a trend-level (p = 0.052) decrease in temporal difference-related activation in the VS during reward anticipation and delivery combined. Moreover, gPPI analyses revealed that during reward anticipation, MDD patients exhibited decreased functional connectivity between the VS and anterior cingulate cortex / medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, angular/middle orbital gyrus, left insula, superior/middle frontal gyrus (SFG/MFG) and precuneus/superior occipital gyrus/cerebellum compared to HC. Moreover, MDD patients showed decreased functional connectivity between the VTA and left insula compared to HC during reward anticipation. Exploratory analysis separating medication free patients from patients using anti-depressant revealed that these decreased functional connectivity patterns were mainly apparent in the MDD group that used antidepressants. These results suggest that MDD is characterized by alterations in reward circuit connectivity rather than isolated activation impairments. These findings represent an important extension of the existing literature since improved understanding of neural pathways underlying depression-related reward dysfunctions, may help currently unmet diagnostic and therapeutic efforts.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- gPPI - difficult to extract information, no explicit mention of correlation coefficient etc 		PPI			
Yu, JH and Fischer, NL and Yu, Junhong and Fischer, Nastassja L.	Asymmetric generalizability of multimodal brain-behavior associations across age-groups	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Machine learning methods have increasingly been used to map out brain-behavior associations (BBA), and to predict out-of-scanner behavior of unseen subjects. Given the brain changes that occur in the context of aging, the accuracy of these predictions is likely to depend on how similar the training and testing data sets are in terms of age. To this end, we examined how well BBAs derived from an age-group generalize to other age-groups. We partitioned the CAM-CAN data set (N = 550) into the young, middle, and old age-groups, then used the young and old age-groups to construct prediction models for 11 behavioral outcomes using multimodal neuroimaging features (i.e., structural and resting-state functional connectivity, and gray matter volume/cortical thickness). These models were then applied to all three age-groups to predict their behavioral scores. When the young-derived models were used, a graded pattern of age-generalization was generally observed across most behavioral outcomes-predictions are the most accurate in the young subjects in the testing data set, followed by the middle and then old-aged subjects. Conversely, when the old-derived models were used, the disparity in the predictive accuracy across age-groups was mostly negligible. These findings hold across different imaging modalities. These results suggest the asymmetric age-generalization of BBAs-old-derived BBAs generalized well to all age-groups, however young-derived BBAs generalized poorly beyond their own age-group.	550	NA	NA	- separated into groups: 183+184+183	246	NA	regression	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (low pass filtering, global signal regression)	no			#NAAM?

Estimations of the weather effects on brain functions using functional MRI: A cautionary note	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	The influences of environmental factors such as weather on the human brain are still largely unknown. A few neuroimaging studies have demonstrated seasonal effects, but were limited by their cross-sectional design or sample sizes. Most importantly, the stability of the MRI scanner has not been taken into account, which may also be affected by environments. In the current study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from eight individuals, where they were scanned over months to years. We applied machine learning regression to use different resting-state parameters, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity matrix, to predict different weather and environmental parameters. For careful control, the raw EPI and the anatomical images were also used for predictions. We first found that daylight length and air temperatures could be reliably predicted with cross-validation using the resting-state parameters. However, similar prediction accuracies could also be achieved by using one frame of EPI image, and even higher accuracies could be achieved by using the segmented or raw anatomical images. Finally, the signals outside of the brain in the anatomical images and signals in phantom scans could also achieve higher prediction accuracies, suggesting that the predictability may be due to the baseline signals of the MRI scanner. After all, we did not identify detectable influences of weather on brain functions other than the influences on the baseline signals of MRI scanners.

Subregions of DLPFC Display Graded yet Distinct Structural and Functional Connectivity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	The human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; approximately corresponding to Brodmann areas 9 and 46) has demon-strable roles in diverse executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract reasoning. However, it remains unclear whether this is the result of one functionally homogeneous region or whether there are functional subdivisions within the DLPFC. Here, we divided the DLPFC into seven areas along rostral-caudal and dorsal -ventral axes anatomically and explored their respective patterns of structural and functional connectivity. In vivo probabilistic tractography (11 females and 13 males) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; 57 females and 21 males) were employed to map out the patterns of connectivity from each DLPFC subregion. Structural connectivity demon-strated graded intraregional connectivity within the DLPFC. The patterns of structural connectivity between the DLPFC sub -regions and other cortical areas revealed that the dorsal-rostral subregions connections were restricted to other frontal and limbic areas, whereas the ventral-caudal region was widely connected to frontal, parietal, and limbic cortex. Functional con-nectivity analyses demonstrated that subregions of DLPFC were strongly interconnected to each other. The dorsal subregions were associated with the default mode network (DMN), while middle dorsal-rostral subregions were linked with the multiple demand network (MDN). The ventral-caudal subregion showed increased functional coupling with both DMN and MDN. Our results suggest that the connectivity of the DLPFC may be subdivided along a dorsorostral-ventrocaudal axis with differing (albeit graded) patterns of connectivity reflecting the integrative executive function of the DLPFC.	78	NA	NA	- additional dataset with n = 24 but only for structural MRI	7	NA	correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering, global signal regression)	no

Multimodal classification of extremely preterm and term adolescents using the fusiform gyrus: A machine learning approach	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Objective: Extremely preterm birth has been associated with atypical visual and neural processing of faces, as well as differences in gray matter structure in visual processing areas relative to full-term peers. In particular, the right fusiform gyrus, a core visual area involved in face processing, has been shown to have structural and functional differences between preterm and full-term individuals from childhood through early adulthood. The current study used multiple neuroimaging modalities to build a machine learning model based on the right fusiform gyrus to classify extremely preterm birth status. Method: Extremely preterm adolescents (n = 20) and full-term peers (n = 24) underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Group differences in gray matter density, measured via voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to face stimuli were explored within the right fusiform. Using group difference clusters as seed regions, analyses investigating outgoing white matter streamlines, regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity during a face processing task and at rest were conducted. A data driven approach was utilized to determine the most discriminative combination of these features within a linear support vector machine classifier. Results: Group differences in two partially overlapping clusters emerged: one from the VBM analysis showing less density in the extremely preterm cohort and one from BOLD response to faces showing greater activation in the extremely preterm relative to full-term youth. A classifier fit to the data from the cluster identified in the BOLD analysis achieved an accuracy score of 88.64% when BOLD, gray matter density, regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity during the task and at rest were included. A classifier fit to the data from the cluster identified in the VBM analysis achieved an accuracy score of 95.45% when only BOLD, gray matter density, and regional homogeneity were included. Conclusion: Consistent with previous findings, we observed neural differences in extremely preterm youth in an area that plays an important role in face processing. Multimodal analyses revealed differences in structure, function, and connectivity that, when taken together, accurately distinguish extremely preterm from full-term born youth. Our findings suggest a compensatory role of the fusiform where less dense gray matter is countered by increased local BOLD signal. Importantly, sub-threshold differences in many modalities within the same region were informative when distinguishing between extremely preterm and full-term youth.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- gPPI - toolbox appplied, no information on how network was constructed: ""2.4.3.2.

Connectivity-Defined Subdivisions of the Intraparietal Sulcus Respond Differentially to Abstraction during Decision-Making	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) has been implicated in numerous functions that range from representation of visual stimuli to action planning, but its role in abstract decision-making has been unclear, in part because low-level functions often act as confounds. Here, we address this problem using a task that dissociates abstract decision-making from sensory salience, atten-tional control, motor planning, and motor output. Functional MRI data were collected from healthy female and male human subjects while they performed a policy abstraction task requiring use of a more abstract (second-order) rule to select between two less abstract (first-order) rules that informed the motor response. By identifying IPS subdivisions with preferential con-nectivity to prefrontal regions that are differentially responsive to task abstraction, we found that a caudal IPS (cIPS) subre-gion with strongest connectivity to the pre-premotor cortex was preferentially active for second-order cues, whereas a rostral IPS subregion (rIPS) with strongest connectivity to the dorsal premotor cortex was active during attentional control over first-order cues. These effects for abstraction were seen in addition to cIPS activity that was specific to sensory salience, and rIPS activity that was specific to motor output. Notably, topographic responses to the second-order cue were detected along the caudal-rostral axis of IPS, mirroring the broader organization seen in lateral prefrontal cortex. Together, these data dem-onstrate that subregions within IPS exhibit activity responsive to policy abstraction, and they suggest that IPS may be organ-ized into frontoparietal subnetworks that support hierarchical cognitive control.	100	NA	NA	- experiment sample n=11 - rsFC was created with n = 100 (HCP)	1000	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression using ICA-FIX, global signal regression)	no			#NAAM?

Whether these transitions or explorations follow some underlying arrangement or lack a predictable ordered plan remains to be determined. Here, using fMRI data from highly sampled individuals (similar to 5 hours of resting-state data per individual), we aimed to reveal the rules that govern transitions in brain activity at rest. Our Topological Data Analysis based Mapper approach characterized a highly visited transition state of the brain that acts as a switch between different neural configurations to organize the spontaneous brain activity. Further, while the transition state was characterized by a uniform representation of canonical resting-state networks (RSNs), the periphery of the landscape was dominated by a subject-specific combination of RSNs. Altogether, we revealed rules or principles that organize spontaneous brain activity using a precision dynamics approach.	10	NA	NA	- all healthy -76(HCP) as testing data set	477	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (low- and band-pass filtering, global signal regression, nuisance covariate regression) 	no			- network size: two types used 1. 333 regions atlas-based, 2. parcellation created individually per participant 620 ± 39.4 nodes, averaged for network size column   - do not report pearson in text but fig 5 seems to imply full correlation + weights

One possible way to address this issue is to evaluate all possible analyses using a multiverse approach, however, this can be computationally challenging and sequential analyses on the same data can compromise predictive power. Here, we establish how active learning on a low-dimensional space capturing the inter-relationships between pipelines can efficiently approximate the full spectrum of analyses. This approach balances the benefits of a multiverse analysis without incurring the cost on computational and predictive power. We illustrate this approach with two functional MRI datasets (predicting brain age and autism diagnosis) demonstrating how a multiverse of analyses can be efficiently navigated and mapped out using active learning. Furthermore, our presented approach not only identifies the subset of analysis techniques that are best able to predict age or classify individuals with autism spectrum disorder and healthy controls, but it also allows the relationships between analyses to be quantified. Most neuroimaging studies are associated with a broad range analytic and methodological choices that the researcher needs to make, but every choice might lead to different answers, and evaluating all possible analytic choices is computationally challenging. Here, authors present a framework that maps the space of analysis by creating a low-dimensional space and using a Bayesian optimization to navigate it.	882	406	476		346	NA	multiple	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering, global signal regression)	no			"- modelling: data was processed using regression, which indicates that individual data was aggregated? - association: full correlation, partial correlation, tangent correlation, covariance - quote ""Functional connectivity metric: We also explore four different ways to compute the functional connectivity interaction: covariance, correlation, tangent and partial correlation.

Path analysis: A method to estimate altered pathways in time-varying graphs of neuroimaging data	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE	Graph-theoretical methods have been widely used to study human brain networks in psychiatric disorders. However, the focus has primarily been on global graphic metrics with little attention to the information contained in paths connecting brain regions. Details of disruption of these paths may be highly informative for understanding disease mechanisms. To detect the absence or addition of multistep paths in the patient group, we provide an algorithm estimating edges that contribute to these paths with reference to the control group. We next examine where pairs of nodes were connected through paths in both groups by using a covariance decomposition method. We apply our method to study resting-state fMRI data in schizophrenia versus controls. Results show several disconnectors in schizophrenia within and between functional domains, particularly within the default mode and cognitive control networks. Additionally, we identify new edges generating additional paths. Moreover, although paths exist in both groups, these paths take unique trajectories and have a significant contribution to the decomposition. The proposed path analysis provides a way to characterize individuals by evaluating changes in paths, rather than just focusing on the pairwise relationships. Our results show promise for identifying path-based metrics in neuroimaging data.	311	151	160	- samples of 823(HCP)+1005(GSP) used to create neuromark template	53	NA	partial correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: age (sample matching), gender (sample matching), scan related (motion (preprocessing and sample matching)) 	no			#NAAM?

However, knowledge about its measurement characteristics compared to reference standard perfusion imaging is limited. This study longitudinally evaluated perfusion in patients with steno-occlusive disease using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) acquired before and within nine days of anterior circulation revascularization in patients with large cerebral artery steno-occlusive diseases. The reliability and sensitivity to longitudinal changes of rsfMRI temporal correlation (Rc) and time delay (TDc) relative to the cerebellar signal were examined voxel-wise in comparison with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) cerebral blood flow (CBF) using the within-subject standard deviation (Sw) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). For statistical comparisons, the standard deviation (SD) of longitudinal changes within the cerebellum, the number of voxels with significant changes in the left middle cerebral artery territory ipsilateral to surgery, and their average changes relative to the cerebellar SD were evaluated. The test-retest reliability of the fMRI met-rics was also similarly evaluated using the human connectome project (HCP) healthy young adult dataset. The test-retest time interval was 31 +/- 18 days. Test-retest reliability was significantly higher for SPECT (cerebellar SD: -2.59 +/- 0.20) than for fMRI metrics (cerebellar SD: Rc, - 2.34 +/- 0.24, p = 0.04; TDc, - 2.19 +/- 0.21, p = 0.003). Sensitivity to postoperative changes, which was evaluated as the number of voxels, was significantly higher for fMRI TDc (8.78 +/- 0.72) than for Rc (7.42 +/- 1.48, p = 0.03) or SPECT CBF (6.88 +/- 0.67, p < 0.001). The ratio between the average Rc, TDc, and SPECT CBF changes within the left MCA target region and cerebellar SD was also significantly higher for fMRI TDc (1.21 +/- 0.79) than Rc (0.48 +/- 0.94, p = 0.006) or SPECT CBF (0.23 +/- 0.57, p = 0.001). The measurement variability of time delay was also larger than that of temporal correlation in HCP data within the cerebellum ( t = -8.7, p < 0.001) or in the whole-brain ( t = -27.4, p < 0.001) gray matter. These data suggest that fMRI time delay is more sensitive to the hemodynamic changes than SPECT CBF, although the reliability is lower. The implication for fMRI connectivity studies is that temporal correlation can be significantly decreased due to altered hemodynamics, even in cases with normal CBF.	12	12	NA	NA	NA	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, linear trend removal), physiological (band pass filtering)	no			- pearson's r  - number of nodes = all voxels in the brain		no

Neuroimaging evidence for the direct role of auditory scene analysis in object perception	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA) refers to the grouping of acoustic signals into auditory objects. Previously, we have shown that perceived musicality of auditory sequences varies with high-level organizational features. Here, we explore the neural mechanisms mediating ASA and auditory object perception. Participants performed musicality judgments on randomly generated pure-tone sequences and manipulated versions of each sequence containing low-level changes (amplitude; timbre). Low-level manipulations affected auditory object perception as evidenced by changes in musicality ratings. fMRI was used to measure neural activation to sequences rated most and least musical, and the altered versions of each sequence. Next, we generated two partially overlapping networks: (i) a music processing network (music localizer) and (ii) an ASA network (base sequences vs. ASA manipulated sequences). Using Representational Similarity Analysis, we correlated the functional profiles of each ROI to a model generated from behavioral musicality ratings as well as models corresponding to low-level feature processing and music perception. Within overlapping regions, areas near primary auditory cortex correlated with low-level ASA models, whereas right IPS was correlated with musicality ratings. Shared neural mechanisms that correlate with behavior and underlie both ASA and music perception suggests that low-level features of auditory stimuli play a role in auditory object perception.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?

Verbal production dynamics and plasticity: functional contributions of language and executive control systems	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Bilingual language production requires both language knowledge and language control in order to communicate in a target language. Learning or improving a language in adulthood is an increasingly common undertaking, and this has complex effects on the cognitive and neural processes underlying language production. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment investigated the functional plasticity of verbal production in adult language learners, and examined the dynamics of word retrieval in order to dissociate the contributions of language knowledge and executive control. Thirty four adults who were either intermediate or advanced language learners, underwent MRI scanning while performing verbal fluency tasks in their native and new languages. A multipronged analytical approach revealed (i) time-varying contributions of language knowledge and executive control to verbal fluency performance, (ii) learning-related changes in the functional correlates of verbal fluency in both the native and new languages, (iii) no effect of learning on lateralization, and (iv) greater functional coupling between language and language control regions with greater second language experience. Collectively, our results point to significant functional plasticity in adult language learners that impacts the neural correlates of production in both the native and new languages, and provide new insight into the widely used verbal fluency task.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?

The cognitive-interoceptive appraisal of threat-related stimuli relies on dynamic neural computations between the anterior insular (AIC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) cortices. If, to what extent, and how microbial consortia influence the activity of this cortical threat processing circuitry is unclear. We addressed this question by combining a threat processing task, neuroimaging, 16S rRNA profiling and computational modelling in healthy participants. Results showed interactions between high-level ecological indices with threat-related AIC-dACC neural dynamics. At finer taxonomic resolutions, the abundance of Ruminococcus was differentially linked to connectivity between, and activity within the AIC and dACC during threat updating. Functional inference analysis provides a strong rationale to motivate future investigations of microbiota-derived metabolites in the observed relationship with threat-related brain processes.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Cognitive decline and hippocampal functional connectivity within older Black adults	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	While there has been a proliferation of neuroimaging studies on cognitive decline in older non-Hispanic White adults, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding neuroimaging correlates of cognitive decline in Black adults. Resting-state functional neuroimaging approaches may be particularly sensitive to early cognitive decline, but there are no studies that we know of that apply this approach to examining associations of brain function to cognition in older Black adults. We investigated the association of cognitive decline with whole-brain voxel-wise functional connectivity to the hippocampus, a key brain region functionally implicated in early Alzheimer's dementia, in 132 older Black adults without dementia participating in the Minority Aging Research Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, two longitudinal studies of aging that include harmonized annual cognitive assessments and magnetic resonance imaging brain imaging. In models adjusted for demographic factors (age, education, sex), global cognitive decline was associated with functional connectivity of the hippocampus to three clusters in the right and left frontal regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In domain-specific analyses, decline in semantic memory was associated with functional connectivity of the hippocampus to bilateral clusters in the precentral gyrus, and decline in perceptual speed was inversely associated with connectivity of the hippocampus to the bilateral intracalcarine cortex and the right fusiform gyrus. These findings elucidate neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in older Black adults and may point to specific targets of intervention for Alzheimer's disease.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

It is studied widely, both to gain insight into the brain's intrinsic organization but also to develop markers sensitive to changes in an individual's cognitive, clinical, and developmental state. Despite this, the origins and drivers of functional connectivity, especially at the level of densely sampled individuals, remain elusive. Here, we leverage novel methodology to decompose functional connectivity into its precise framewise contributions. Using two dense sampling datasets, we investigate the origins of individualized functional connectivity, focusing specifically on the role of brain network ""events""- short-lived and peaked patterns of high-amplitude cofluctuations. Here, we develop a statistical test to identify events in empirical recordings. We show that the patterns of cofluctuation expressed during events are repeated across multiple scans of the same individual and represent idiosyncratic variants of template patterns that are expressed at the group level. Lastly, we propose a simple model of functional connectivity based on event cofluctuations, demonstrating that group-averaged cofluctuations are suboptimal for explaining participant-specific connectivity. Our work complements recent studies implicating brief instants of high-amplitude cofluctuations as the primary drivers of static, whole-brain functional connectivity. Our work also extends those studies, demonstrating that cofluctuations during events are individualized, positing a dynamic basis for functional connectivity."	10	NA	10		482	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band pass filtering)	no			- two data sets (Midnight Scan Club and MyConnectome) - n only specified for Midnight Scan Club - parcellations: N=333 (MSC) and N=630 (MyConnectome), averaged for network size

Recognizing this challenge, much effort has been made in recent neuroimaging studies to find biologically more homogeneous subgroups (called 'neurosubtypes') in autism. However, most approaches have rarely evaluated how much the employed features in subtyping represent the core anomalies of ASD, obscuring its utility in actual clinical diagnosis. To address this, we combined two data-driven methods, 'connectome-based gradient' and 'functional random forest', collectively allowing to discover reproducible neurosubtypes based on resting-state functional connectivity profiles that are specific to ASD. Indeed, the former technique provides the features (as input for subtyping) that effectively summarize whole-brain connectome variations in both normal and ASD conditions, while the latter leverages a supervised random forest algorithm to inform diagnostic labels to clustering, which makes neurosubtyping driven by the features of ASD core anomalies. Applying this framework to the open-sharing Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange repository data (discovery, n = 103/108 for ASD/typically developing [TD]; replication, n = 44/42 for ASD/TD), we found three dominant subtypes of functional gradients in ASD and three subtypes in TD. The subtypes in ASD revealed distinct connectome profiles in multiple brain areas, which are associated with different Neurosynth-derived cognitive functions previously implicated in autism studies. Moreover, these subtypes showed different symptom severity, which degree co-varies with the extent of functional gradient changes observed across the groups. The subtypes in the discovery and replication datasets showed similar symptom profiles in social interaction and communication domains, confirming a largely reproducible brain-behavior relationship. Finally, the connectome gradients in ASD subtypes present both common and distinct patterns compared to those in TD, reflecting their potential overlap and divergence in terms of developmental mechanisms involved in the manifestation of large-scale functional networks. Our study demonstrated a potential of the diagnosis-informed subtyping approach in developing a clinically useful brain-based classification system for future ASD research.	211	103	108	- replication dataset: 44 (patients) + 42 (HC)	360	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering)	no

Network dynamics scale with levels of awareness	NEUROIMAGE	Small world topologies are thought to provide a valuable insight into human brain organisation and consciousness. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in consciousness have not yielded consistent results. Given the importance of dynamics for both consciousness and cognition, here we investigate how the diversity of small world dynamics (quantified by sample entropy; dSW-E-1) scales with decreasing levels of awareness (i.e., sedation and disorders of consciousness). Paying particular attention to result reproducibility, we show that dSW-E is a consistent predictor of levels of awareness even when controlling for the underlying functional connectivity dynamics. We find that dSW-E of subcortical, and cortical areas are predictive, with the former showing higher and more robust effect sizes across analyses. We find that the network dynamics of intermodular communication in the cerebellum also have unique predictive power for levels of awareness. Consequently, we propose that the dynamic reorganisation of the functional information architecture, in particular of the subcortex, is a characteristic that emerges with awareness and has explanatory power beyond that of the complexity of dynamic functional connectivity.	18	NA	18	NA	340	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (removal of cardiac/respiration artifacts using nuisance covariate regression, band pass filtering)	no			- use two parcellations (126 and 553) which were averaged for network size

However, there are limited studies on early onset psychosis (EOP), and their results show lack of agreement. Here, we investigated within-network DMN connectivity in EOP compared to healthy controls (HC), and its relationship to clinical characteristics. A sample of 68 adolescent patients with EOP (mean age 16.53 +/- 1.12 [SD] years, females 66%) and 95 HC (mean age 16.24 +/- 1.50 [SD], females 60%) from two Scandinavian cohorts underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). A group independent component analysis (ICA) was performed to identify the DMN across all participants. Dual regression was used to estimate spatial maps reflecting each participant's DMN network, which were compared between EOP and HC using voxel-wise general linear models and permutation-based analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed within the patient group, to explore associations between diagnostic subcategories and current use of psychotropic medication in relation to connectivity strength. The analysis revealed significantly reduced DMN connectivity in EOP compared to HC in the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, fusiform cortex, putamen, pallidum, amygdala, and insula. The subgroup analysis in the EOP group showed strongest deviations for affective psychosis, followed by other psychotic disorders and schizophrenia. There was no association between DMN connectivity strength and the current use of psychotropic medication. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate weaker DMN connectivity in adolescent patients with EOP compared to healthy peers, and differential effects across diagnostic subcategories, which may inform our understanding of underlying disease mechanisms in EOP.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		no

Striatal networks for tinnitus treatment targeting	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Neuromodulation treatment effect size for bothersome tinnitus may be larger and more predictable by adopting a target selection approach guided by personalized striatal networks or functional connectivity maps. Several corticostriatal mechanisms are likely to play a role in tinnitus, including the dorsal/ventral striatum and the putamen. We examined whether significant tinnitus treatment response by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the caudate nucleus may be related to striatal network increased functional connectivity with tinnitus networks that involve the auditory cortex or ventral cerebellum. The first study was a cross-sectional 2-by-2 factorial design (tinnitus, no tinnitus; hearing loss, normal hearing, n = 68) to define cohort level abnormal functional connectivity maps using high-field 7.0 T resting-state fMRI. The second study was a pilot case-control series (n = 2) to examine whether tinnitus modulation response to caudate tail subdivision stimulation would be contingent on individual level striatal connectivity map relationships with tinnitus networks. Resting-state fMRI identified five caudate subdivisions with abnormal cohort level functional connectivity maps. Of those, two connectivity maps exhibited increased connectivity with tinnitus networks-dorsal caudate head with Heschl's gyrus and caudate tail with the ventral cerebellum. DBS of the caudate tail in the case-series responder resulted in dramatic reductions in tinnitus severity and loudness, in contrast to the nonresponder who showed no tinnitus modulation. The individual level connectivity map of the responder was in alignment with the cohort expectation connectivity map, where the caudate tail exhibited increased connectivity with tinnitus networks, whereas the nonresponder individual level connectivity map did not.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- network construction was automated: ""Cohort level functional connectivity maps or expectations maps were determined using statistical engines in the CONN toolbox..."""		seed-based

A convergent structure-function substrate of cognitive imbalances in autism	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental diagnosis showing substantial phenotypic heterogeneity. A leading example can be found in verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills, which vary from elevated to impaired compared with neurotypical individuals. Moreover, deficits in verbal profiles often coexist with normal or superior performance in the nonverbal domain. Methods To study brain substrates underlying cognitive imbalance in ASD, we capitalized categorical and dimensional IQ profiling as well as multimodal neuroimaging. Results IQ analyses revealed a marked verbal to nonverbal IQ imbalance in ASD across 2 datasets (Dataset-1: 155 ASD, 151 controls; Dataset-2: 270 ASD, 490 controls). Neuroimaging analysis in Dataset-1 revealed a structure-function substrate of cognitive imbalance, characterized by atypical cortical thickening and altered functional integration of language networks alongside sensory and higher cognitive areas. Conclusion Although verbal and nonverbal intelligence have been considered as specifiers unrelated to autism diagnosis, our results indicate that intelligence disparities are accentuated in ASD and reflected by a consistent structure-function substrate affecting multiple brain networks. Our findings motivate the incorporation of cognitive imbalances in future autism research, which may help to parse the phenotypic heterogeneity and inform intervention-oriented subtyping in ASD.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?

Popovych, Oleksandr	Reliability and subject specificity of personalized whole-brain dynamical models	NEUROIMAGE	"Dynamical whole-brain models were developed to link structural (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) together into one framework. Nowadays, they are used to investigate the dynamical regimes of the brain and how these relate to behavioral, clinical and demographic traits. However, there is no comprehensive investigation on how reliable and subject specific the modeling results are given the variability of the empirical FC. In this study, we show that the parameters of these models can be fitted with a ""poor "" to ""good "" reliability depending on the exact implementation of the modeling paradigm. We find, as a general rule of thumb, that enhanced model personalization leads to increasingly reliable model parameters. In addition, we observe no clear effect of the model complexity evaluated by separately sampling results for linear, phase oscillator and neural mass network models. In fact, the most complex neural mass model often yields modeling results with ""poor "" reliability comparable to the simple linear model, but demonstrates an enhanced subject specificity of the model similarity maps. Subsequently, we show that the FC simulated by these models can outperform the empirical FC in terms of both reliability and subject specificity. For the structure-function relationship, simulated FC of individual subjects may be identified from the correlations with the empirical SC with an accuracy up to 70%, but not vice versa for non-linear models. We sample all our findings for 8 distinct brain parcellations and 6 modeling conditions and show that the parcellation-induced effect is much more pronounced for the modeling results than for the empirical data. In sum, this study provides an exploratory account on the reliability and subject specificity of dynamical whole-brain models and may be relevant for their further development and application. In particular, our findings suggest that the application of the dynamical whole-brain modeling should be tightly connected with an estimate of the reliability of the results."	200	NA	200	NA	92	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (ICA-FIX denoising)	no			- nodes: 8 different parcellations used, filled in their average for network size   Desikan-Killiany = 70  von Economo-Koskinas = 86   AAL = 92  Harvard-Oxford = 96   Shen 2013 = 79  Schaefer = 100  MIST = 103 Craddock = 108

Individual intelligence scores were previously predicted from whole-brain connectivity patterns, extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired at rest. Recently, it was shown that task-induced brain activation maps outperform these resting-state connectivity patterns in predicting individual intelligence, suggesting that a cognitively demanding environment improves prediction of cognitive abilities. Here, we use data from the Human Connectome Project to predict task-induced brain activation maps from resting-state fMRI, and proceed to use these predicted activity maps to further predict individual differences in a variety of traits. While models based on original task activation maps remain the most accurate, models based on predicted maps significantly outperformed those based on the resting-state connectome. Thus, we provide a promising approach for the evaluation of measures of human behavior from brain activation maps, that could be used without having participants actually perform the tasks.	847	NA	847	NA	360	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX denoising)	no			#NAAM?					
Honnorat, N and Habes, M and Honnorat, Nicolas and Habes, Mohamad	Covariance shrinkage can assess and improve functional connectomes	NEUROIMAGE	Connectomes derived from resting-state functional MRI scans have significantly benefited from the development of dedicated fMRI motion correction and denoising algorithms. But they are based on empirical correlations that can produce unreliable results in high dimension low sample size settings. A family of statistical estimators, the covariance shrinkage methods, could mitigate this issue. Unfortunately, these methods have rarely been used to correct functional connectomes and no extensive experiment has been conducted so far to compare the shrinkage methods available for this task. In this work, we propose to fix this issue by processing a benchmark dataset made of a thousand high-resolution resting-state fMRI scans provided by the Human Connectome Project to compare the ability of five prominent covariance shrinkage methods to produce reliable functional connectomes at different spatial resolutions and scans duration: the pioneer linear covariance shrinkage method introduced by Ledoit and Wolf, the Oracle Approximating Shrinkage, the QuEST method, the NERCOME method, and a recent analytical approximation of the QuEST approach. Our experiments establish that all covariance shrinkage methods significantly improve functional connectomes derived from short fMRI scans. The Oracle Approximating Shrinkage and the QuEST method produced the best results. Lastly, we present shrinkage intensity charts that can be used for designing and analyzing fMRI studies. These charts indicate that sparse connectomes are difficult to estimate from short fMRI scans, and they describe a range of settings where dynamic functional connectivity should not be computed.	1823	NA	NA	#NAAM?	400	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX denoising, global signal regression, band pass filtering)	no			#NAAM?

Synthesizing pseudo-T2w images to recapture missing data in neonatal neuroimaging with applications in rs-fMRI	NEUROIMAGE	T1-and T2-weighted (T1w and T2w) images are essential for tissue classification and anatomical localization in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analyses. However, these anatomical data can be challenging to acquire in non-sedated neonatal cohorts, which are prone to high amplitude movement and display lower tissue contrast than adults. As a result, one of these modalities may be missing or of such poor quality that they cannot be used for accurate image processing, resulting in subject loss. While recent literature attempts to overcome these issues in adult populations using synthetic imaging approaches, evaluation of the efficacy of these methods in pediatric populations and the impact of these techniques in conventional MR analyses has not been performed. In this work, we present two novel methods to generate pseudo-T2w images: the first is based in deep learning and expands upon previous models to 3D imaging without the requirement of paired data, the second is based in nonlinear multi-atlas registration providing a computationally lightweight alternative. We demonstrate the anatomical accuracy of pseudo-T2w images and their efficacy in existing MR processing pipelines in two independent neonatal cohorts. Critically, we show that implementing these pseudo-T2w methods in resting-state functional MRI analyses produces virtually identical functional connectivity results when compared to those resulting from T2w images, confirming their utility in infant MRI studies for salvaging otherwise lost subject data.	107	NA	NA	#NAAM?	333	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band pass filtering)	no			#NAAM?

However, this network's role in language production remains debated. In particular, it remains unclear whether all or only some language regions contribute to production, and which aspects of production these regions support. Across 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments that rely on robust individual-subject analyses, we characterize the language network's response to high-level production demands. We report 3 novel results. First, sentence production, spoken or typed, elicits a strong response throughout the language network. Second, the language network responds to both phrase-structure building and lexical access demands, although the response to phrase-structure building is stronger and more spatially extensive, present in every language region. Finally, contra some proposals, we find no evidence of brain regions-within or outside the language network-that selectively support phrase-structure building in production relative to comprehension. Instead, all language regions respond more strongly during production than comprehension, suggesting that production incurs a greater cost for the language network. Together, these results align with the idea that language comprehension and production draw on the same knowledge representations, which are stored in a distributed manner within the language-selective network and are used to both interpret and generate linguistic utterances.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?

Whether and how detection relates to human capacity for somatosensory spatial discrimination (SD) and temporal discrimination (TD) remains unclear. Here, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning when simply detecting vibrotactile stimuli of the leg, judging their location (SD), or deciding their number in time (TD). By conceptualizing tactile discrimination as consisting of detection and determination processes, we found that tactile detection elicited activation specifically involved in SD within the right inferior and superior parietal lobules, 2 regions previously implicated in the control of spatial attention. These 2 regions remained activated in the determination process, during which functional connectivity between these 2 regions predicted individual SD ability. In contrast, tactile detection produced little activation specifically related to TD. Participants' TD ability was implemented in brain regions implicated in coding temporal structures of somatic stimuli (primary somatosensory cortex) and time estimation (anterior cingulate, pre-supplementary motor area, and putamen). Together, our findings indicate a close link between somatosensory detection and SD (but not TD) at the neural level, which aids in explaining why we can promptly respond toward detected somatic stimuli.														yes	missing information		#NAAM?

Given its various functions, a key question is whether the cerebellum also plays an important role in the brain's integrative functions. Here, we hypothesize the existence of connector regions, also known as connector hubs, where multiple resting state networks converged in the cerebellum. To verify this, we employed a recently developed voxel-level network measure called functional connectivity overlap ratio (FCOR), which could be used to quantify the spatial extent of a region's connection to several large-scale cortical networks. Using resting state functional MRI data from 101 healthy participants, cerebellar FCOR maps were constructed and used to identify the locations of connector hubs in the cerebellum. Results showed that a number of cerebellar regions exhibited strong connectivity with multiple functional networks, verifying our hypothesis. These highly connected regions were located in the posterior cerebellum, especially in lobules VI, VII, and IX, and mainly connected to the core neurocognitive networks such as default mode and executive control networks. Regions associated with the sensorimotor network were also localized in lobule V, VI, and VIII, albeit in small clusters. These cerebellar connector hubs may play an essential role in the processing of information across the core neurocognitive networks.	101	NA	101	NA	12	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band pass filtering) 	no			- connectivity analysis of cerebellar voxels with functional networks, followed by seed-based analysis.

This suggested that events might be a discrete, temporally sparse signal which drives functional connectivity (FC) over the timeseries. However, a different, not yet explored possibility is that network informa-tion differences between time points are driven by sampling variability on a constant, static, noisy signal. Using a combination of real and simulated data, we examined the relationship between cofluctuation and network structure and asked if this relationship was unique, or if it could arise from sampling variability alone. First, we show that events are not discrete - there is a gradually increasing relationship between network structure and cofluctuation; similar to 50% of samples show very strong network structure. Second, using simulations we show that this relationship is predicted from sampling variability on static FC. Finally, we show that randomly selected points can capture network structure about as well as events, largely because of their temporal spacing. Together, these results suggest that, while events exhibit particularly strong representations of static FC, there is little evidence that events are unique timepoints that drive FC structure. Instead, a parsimonious explanation for the data is that events arise from a single static, but noisy, FC structure."	10	NA	NA	NA	333	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	no	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, low- and band-pass filtering) 	no			"- binarization for modularity analysis: "".

Todd	Arousal impacts distributed hubs modulating the integration of brain functional connectivity	NEUROIMAGE	Even when subjects are at rest, it is thought that brain activity is organized into distinct brain states during which reproducible patterns are observable. Yet, it is unclear how to define or distinguish different brain states. A potential source of brain state variation is arousal, which may play a role in modulating functional interactions between brain regions. Here, we use simultaneous resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pupillometry to study the impact of arousal levels indexed by pupil area on the integration of large-scale brain networks. We employ a novel sparse dictionary learning-based method to identify hub regions participating in between-network integration stratified by arousal, by measuring k-hubness, the number (k) of functionally overlapping networks in each brain region. We show evidence of a brain-wide decrease in between-network integration and inter-subject variability at low relative to high arousal, with differences emerging across regions of the frontoparietal, default mode, motor, limbic, and cerebellum networks. State-dependent changes in k-hubness relate to the actual patterns of network integration within these hubs, suggesting a brain state transition from high to low arousal characterized by global synchronization and reduced network overlaps. We demonstrate that arousal is not limited to specific brain areas known to be directly associated with arousal regulation, but instead has a brain-wide impact that involves high-level between-network communications. Lastly, we show a systematic change in pairwise fMRI signal correlation structures in the arousal state-stratified data, and demonstrate that the choice of global signal regression could result in different conclusions in conventional graph theoretical analysis and in the analysis of k-hubness when studying arousal modulations. Together, our results suggest the presence of global and local effects of pupil-linked arousal modulations on resting state brain functional connectivity.	37	NA	37	NA	268	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (multiple)	both	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, low-pass filtering) 	no			- used both weighted and binarised edges - for binarised: edges were thresholded  - for non-binarised: only non-negative edges were retained and negative ones set to 0			task-based connectivity study -which I think we excluded?

Here we use structural disconnection maps from individual lesions to derive a causal mechanistic generative whole-brain model able to explain both functional connectivity alterations and behavioral deficits induced by stroke. As compared to other models that use only the local lesion information, the similarity to the empirical fMRI connectivity increases when the widespread structural disconnection information is considered. The presented model classifies behavioral impairment severity with higher accuracy than other types of information (e.g.: functional connectivity). We assessed topological measures that characterize the functional effects of damage. With the obtained results, we were able to understand how network dynamics change emerge, in a nontrivial way, after a stroke injury of the underlying complex brain system. This type of modeling, including structural disconnection information, helps to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of stroke lesions.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Predicting individual task contrasts from resting-state functional connectivity using a surface-based convolutional network	NEUROIMAGE	Task-based and resting-state represent the two most common experimental paradigms of functional neuroimaging. While resting-state offers a flexible and scalable approach for characterizing brain function, task-based techniques provide superior localization. In this paper, we build on recent deep learning methods to create a model that predicts task-based contrast maps from resting-state fMRI scans. Specifically, we propose BrainSurfCNN, a surface -based fully-convolutional neural network model that works with a representation of the brain's cortical sheet. BrainSurfCNN achieves exceptional predictive accuracy on independent test data from the Human Connectome Project, which is on par with the repeat reliability of the measured subject-level contrast maps. Conversely, our analyses reveal that a previously published benchmark is no better than group-average contrast maps. Finally, we demonstrate that BrainSurfCNN can generalize remarkably well to novel domains with limited training data.	919	0	919	they repeat the analysis in 39 held out HCP controls, and in two other datasets that contain ~250 (AOMIC) and 12 (IBC) healthy controls	32492	84	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression) 	no			- network size: 84  components + 32492 vertices  - Linda: I would say that the components are networks, so 84, but that might not be super relevant to include since it is such a weird method		no

Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that behavioral processes are relatively inexpensive metabolically, and that most energy goes to maintaining the status quo, i.e., the balance of cell membranes' resting potentials and subthreshold spontaneous activity. Spontaneous activity fluctuates across brain regions in a correlated fashion that defines mull-scale hierarchical networks called resting-state networks (RSNs). Different regions of the brain display different metabolic consumption, but the relationship between regional brain metabolism and RSNs is still under investigation. Here, we examine the variability of glucose metabolism across brain regions, measured with the relative standard uptake value (SUVR) using F-18-FDG PET, and the topology of RSNs, measured through graph analysis applied to fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (FC). We found a moderate linear relationship between the strength (STR) of pairwise regional FC and metabolism. Moreover, the linear correlation between SUVR and STR grew stronger as we considered more connected regions (hubs). Regions connecting different RSNs, or connector hubs, showed higher SUVR than regions connecting nodes within the same RSN, or provincial hubs. Our results show that functional connections as probed by fMRI are related to glucose metabolism, especially in a system of provincial and connector hubs.	28	NA	28	NA	347	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, high-pass filtering) 	no

Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is capable of identifying unique patterns from functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions. Recent work has built a link between brain networks in resting state to dishonesty in Western participants. To determine and reproduce the relevant neural patterns and build an interpretable model to predict dishonesty, we analyzed two conceptually similar datasets containing rsfMRI data with different dishonesty tasks. Both tasks implemented the information-passing paradigm, in which monetary rewards were employed to induce dishonesty. We applied connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to build a model among FC within and between four social brain networks (reward, self-referential, moral, and cognitive control). The CPM analysis indicated that FCs of social brain networks are predictive of dishonesty rate, especially FCs within reward network, and between self-referential and cognitive control networks. Our study offers an conceptual replication with integrated model to predict dishonesty with rsfMRI, and the results suggest that frequent motivated dishonest decisions may require the higher engagement of social brain regions.	29	NA	29	NA	112	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering) 	no

This network comprises neurons that directly, or indirectly mediate communication between brain regions. Here, we show how multilayer/multiplex network analysis provides a suitable framework to uncover the throughput of structural connectivity (SC) to mediate information transfer -giving rise to functional connectivity (FC). Method: We implemented a novel method to reconcile SC and FC using diffusion and resting-state functional MRI connectivity data from 484 subjects (272 females, 212 males; age = 29.15 +/- 3.47) from the Human Connectome Project. First, we counted the number of direct and indirect structural paths that mediate FC. FC nodes with indirect SC paths were then weighted according to their least restrictive SC path. We refer to this as SC-FC Bandwidth . We then mapped paths with the highest SC-FC Bandwidth across 7 canonical resting-state networks. Findings: We found that most pairs of FC nodes were connected by SC paths of length two and three (SC paths of length > 5 were virtually non-existent). Direct SC-FC connections accounted for only 10% of all SC-FC connections. The majority of FC nodes without a direct SC path were mediated by a proportion of two (44%) or three SC path lengths (39%). Only a small proportion of FC nodes were mediated by SC path lengths of four (5%). We found high-bandwidth direct SC-FC connections show dense intra-and sparse inter-network connectivity, with a bilateral, anteroposterior distribution. High bandwidth SC-FC triangles have a right superomedial distribution within the somatomotor network. High-bandwidth SC-FC quads have a superoposterior distribution within the default mode network. Conclusion: Our method allows the measurement of indirect SC-FC using undirected, weighted graphs derived from multimodal MRI data in order to map the location and throughput of SC to mediate FC. An extension of this work may be to explore how SC-FC Bandwidth changes over time, relates to cognition/behavior, and if this measure reflects a marker of neurological injury or psychiatric disorders.	484	NA	484	NA	219	NA	partial correlation	individual	yes (multiple)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering)  	no			- edge selection: only positive edges selected, then thresholded by using regularisation

T.	Comparison of individualized behavioral predictions across anatomical, diffusion and functional connectivity MRI	NEUROIMAGE	A fundamental goal across the neurosciences is the characterization of relationships linking brain anatomy, func-tioning, and behavior. Although various MRI modalities have been developed to probe these relationships, direct comparisons of their ability to predict behavior have been lacking. Here, we compared the ability of anatomical T1, diffusion and functional MRI (fMRI) to predict behavior at an individual level. Cortical thickness, area and volume were extracted from anatomical T1 images. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and approximate Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) models were fitted to the diffusion images. The resulting metrics were projected to the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) skeleton. We also ran probabilistic tractogra-phy for the diffusion images, from which we extracted the stream count, average stream length, and the average of each DTI and NODDI metric across tracts connecting each pair of brain regions. Functional connectivity (FC) was extracted from both task and resting-state fMRI. Individualized prediction of a wide range of behavioral mea-sures were performed using kernel ridge regression, linear ridge regression and elastic net regression. Consistency of the results were investigated with the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive De-velopment (ABCD) datasets. In both datasets, FC-based models gave the best prediction performance, regardless of regression model or behavioral measure. This was especially true for the cognitive component. Furthermore, all modalities were able to predict cognition better than other behavioral components. Combining all modalities improved prediction of cognition, but not other behavioral components. Finally, across all behaviors, combining resting and task FC yielded prediction performance similar to combining all modalities. Overall, our study sug-gests that in the case of healthy children and young adults, behaviorally-relevant information in T1 and diffusion features might reflect a subset of the variance captured by FC.	1823	NA	NA	#NAAM?	400	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering)   	no			#NAAM?

While previous studies using pattern recognition on neuroimaging data have shown differences between various discrete emotions in brain activity patterns, less is known about the differences in functional connectivity. Thus, we employed multivariate pattern analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging data (i) to develop a pipeline for applying pattern recognition in functional connectivity data, and (ii) to test whether connectivity patterns differ across emotion categories. Six emotions (anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral state were induced in 16 participants using one-minute-long emotional narratives with natural prosody while brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We computed emotion-wise connectivity matrices both for whole-brain connections and for 10 previously defined functionally connected brain subnetworks and trained an across-participant classifier to categorize the emotional states based on whole-brain data and for each subnetwork separately. The whole-brain classifier performed above chance level with all emotions except sadness, suggesting that different emotions are characterized by differences in large-scale connectivity patterns. When focusing on the connectivity within the 10 subnetworks, classification was successful within the default mode system and for all emotions. We thus show preliminary evidence for consistently different sustained functional connectivity patterns for instances of emotion categories particularly within the default mode system.	16	NA	16	NA	264	10	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, scanner trend), physiological (DRIFTER removal of cardiac/respiration artifacts, band-pass filtering) 	no		after: other (baseline FC regressed out from the emotion-wise FC matrices) >> to obtain emotion-specific FC, so this is not considered deconfounding	- 264 nodes and 10 subnetworks  - no mention of edge weights or selection

Nevertheless, the connectivity of arousal and motor brainstem nuclei is understudied in living humans due to the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution of conventional imaging, and to the lack of atlases of these deep tiny regions of the brain. For a holistic comprehension of sleep, arousal and associated motor processes, we investigated in 20 healthy subjects the resting-state functional connectivity of 18 arousal and motor brainstem nuclei in living humans. To do so, we used high spatial-resolution 7 Tesla resting-state fMRI, as well as a recently developed in-vivo probabilistic atlas of these nuclei in stereotactic space. Further, we verified the translatability of our brainstem connectome approach to conventional (e.g. 3 Tesla) fMRI. Arousal brainstem nuclei displayed high interconnectivity, as well as connectivity to the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal forebrain and frontal cortex, in line with animal studies and as expected for arousal regions. Motor brainstem nuclei showed expected connectivity to the cerebellum, basal ganglia and motor cortex, as well as high interconnectivity. Comparison of 3 Tesla to 7 Tesla connectivity results indicated good translatability of our brainstem connectome approach to conventional fMRI, especially for cortical and subcortical (non-brainstem) targets and to a lesser extent for brainstem targets. The functional connectome of 18 arousal and motor brainstem nuclei with the rest of the brain might provide a better understanding of arousal, sleep and accompanying motor functions in living humans in health and disease.	20	NA	20	NA	258	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (cardiac/respiration artifact removal using nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering) 	no			"- don't understand their nodes: ""For each subject, we averaged the time-courses within seed and target regions (or “nodes”) and computed the Pearson correlation coefficient across them, generating a 31 × 169 correlation matrix (with 31 × (31 − 1)/2 + 31 × (227 − 31) = 6541 correlation values above the diagonal)."

MRI markers of brain network integrity relate to neurological outcome in postanoxic coma	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Aim: Current multimodal approaches leave approximately half of the comatose patients after cardiac arrest with an indeterminate prognosis. Here we investigated whether early MRI markers of brain network integrity can distinguish between comatose patients with a good versus poor neurological outcome six months later.Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study in 48 patients after cardiac arrest submitted in a comatose state to the Intensive Care Unit of two Dutch hospitals. MRI was performed at three days after cardiac arrest, including resting state functional MRI and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). Resting state fMRI was used to quantify functional connectivity within ten resting-state networks, and DTI to assess mean diffusivity (MD) in these same networks. We contrasted two groups of patients, those with good (n = 29, cerebral performance category 1-2) versus poor (n = 19, cerebral performance category 3-5) outcome at six months. Mutual associations between functional connectivity, MD, and clinical outcome were studied. Results: Patients with good outcome show higher within-network functional connectivity (fMRI) and higher MD (DTI) than patients with poor outcome across 8/10 networks, most prominent in the default mode network, salience network, and visual network. While the anatomical distribution of outcome-related changes was similar for functional connectivity and MD, the pattern of inter-individual differences was very different: functional connectivity showed larger inter-individual variability in good versus poor outcome, while the opposite was observed for MD. Exploratory analyses suggested that it is possible to define network-specific cut-off values that could help in outcome prediction: (1) high functional connectivity and high MD, associated with good outcome; (2) low functional connectivity and low MD, associated with poor outcome; (3) low functional connectivity and high MD, associated with uncertain outcome. Discussion: Resting-state functional connectivity and mean diffusivity-three days after cardiac arrest are strongly associated with neurological recovery-six months later in a complementary fashion. The combination of fMRI and MD holds potential to improve prediction of outcome.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- ""For each subject, we regressed the group level spatial map to indi vidual spatial maps of the identified resting state networks, using FSL’s Dual Regression (Beckmann et al., 2009).

Rewarded Extinction Increases Amygdalar Connectivity and Stabilizes Long-Term Memory Traces in the vmPFC	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	Neurobiological evidence in rodents indicates that threat extinction incorporates reward neurocircuitry. Consequently, incor-porating reward associations with an extinction memory may be an effective strategy to persistently attenuate threat responses. Moreover, while there is considerable research on the short-term effects of extinction strategies in humans, the long-term effects of extinction are rarely considered. In a within-subjects fMRI study with both female and male participants, we compared counterconditioning (CC; a form of rewarded-extinction) to standard extinction at recent (24 h) and remote (approximately one month) retrieval tests. Relative to standard extinction, rewarded extinction diminished 24-h relapse of arousal and threat expectancy, and reduced activity in brain regions associated with the appraisal and expression of threat (e.g., thalamus, insula, periaqueductal gray). The retrieval of reward-associated extinction memory was accompanied by func-tional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, whereas the retrieval of standard-extinction memories was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One month later, the re-trieval of both standard-extinction and rewarded-extinction was associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. However, only rewarded extinction created a stable memory trace in the vmPFC, identified through overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity from extinction to 24-h and one-month retrieval. These findings provide new evidence that reward may gener-ate a more stable and enduring memory trace of attenuated threat in humans.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		PPI

Functional brain network community structure in childhood: Unfinished territories and fuzzy boundaries	NEUROIMAGE	Adult cortex is organized into distributed functional communities. Yet, little is known about community architecture of children's brains. Here, we uncovered the community structure of cortex in childhood using fMRI data from 670 children aged 9-11 years (48% female, replication sample= 544 , 56% female) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study. We first applied a data-driven community detection approach to cluster cortical regions into communities, then employed a generative model-based approach called the weighted stochastic block model to further probe community interactions. Children showed similar community structure to adults, as defined by Yeo and colleagues in 2011, in early-developing sensory and motor communities, but differences emerged in transmodal areas. Children have more cortical territory in the limbic community, which is involved in emotion processing, than adults. Regions in association cortex interact more flexibly across communities, creating uncertainty for the model-based assignment algorithm, and perhaps reflecting cortical boundaries that are not yet solidified. Uncertainty was highest for cingulo-opercular areas involved in flexible deployment of cognitive control. Activation and deactivation patterns during a working memory task showed that both the data driven approach and a set of adult communities statistically capture functional organization in middle childhood. Collectively, our findings suggest that community boundaries are not solidified by middle childhood.	670	NA	NA	#NAAM?	1175	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	no	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band pass filtering) 	no			- binariszation to keep the top 10% of the correlations.

In the brainstem, the periaqueductal gray (PAG) ensures survival by generating an appropriate response to these threats. Hence, the experience of pain is coupled with threat signaling and interfaces in the dl/l and vlPAG columns. In this study, we triangulate the functional circuits of the dl/l and vlPAG by using static and time-varying functional connectivity (FC) in multiple fMRI scans in healthy participants ( n = 37, 21 female). The dl/l and vlPAG were activated during cue, heat, and rating periods when the cue signaled a high threat of experiencing heat pain and when the incoming intensity of heat pain was unknown. Responses were significantly lower after low threat cues. The two regions responded similarly to the cued conditions but showed prominent distinctions in the extent of FC with other brain regions. Thus, both static and time-varying FC showed significant differences in the functional circuits of dl/l and vlPAG in rest and task scans. The dl/lPAG consistently synchronized with the salience network and the thalamus, suggesting a role in threat detection, while the vlPAG exhibited more widespread synchronization and frequently connected with memory/language and sensory regions. Hence, these two PAG regions process heat pain when stronger pain is expected or when it is uncertain, and preferentially synchronize with distinct brain circuits in a reproducible manner. The dl/lPAG seems more directly involved in salience detection, while the vlPAG seems engaged in contextualizing threats.	37	NA	37	NA	130	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band pass filtering) 	no			#NAAM?

A cognitive state transformation model for task-general and task-specific subsystems of the brain connectome	NEUROIMAGE	The human brain flexibly controls different cognitive behaviors, such as memory and attention, to satisfy contex-tual demands. Much progress has been made to reveal task-induced modulations in the whole-brain functional connectome, but we still lack a way to model context-dependent changes. Here, we present a novel connectome-to-connectome (C2C) transformation framework that enables us to model the brain's functional reorganization from one connectome state to another in response to specific task goals. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project, we demonstrate that the C2C model accurately generates an individual's task-related connectomes from their task-free (resting-state) connectome with a high degree of specificity across seven different cognitive states. Moreover, the C2C model amplifies behaviorally relevant indi-vidual differences in the task-free connectome, thereby improving behavioral predictions with increased power, achieving similar performance with just a third of the subjects needed when relying on resting-state data alone. Finally, the C2C model reveals how the brain reorganizes between cognitive states. Our observations support the existence of reliable state-specific subsystems in the brain and demonstrate that we can quantitatively model how the connectome reconfigures to different cognitive states, enabling more accurate predictions of behavior with fewer subjects.	316	NA	NA	NA	268	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression) 	no

Multimodal data fusion of cortical-subcortical morphology and functional network connectivity in psychotic spectrum disorder	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Multiple authors have noted overlapping symptoms and alterations across clinical, anatomical, and functional brain features in schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective disorder (SZA), and bipolar disorder (BPI). However, regarding brain features, few studies have approached this line of inquiry using analytical techniques optimally designed to extract the shared features across anatomical and functional information in a simultaneous manner. Univariate studies of anatomical or functional alterations across these disorders can be limited and run the risk of omitting small but potentially crucial overlapping or joint neuroanatomical (e.g., structural images) and functional features (e.g., fMRI-based features) which may serve as informative clinical indicators of across multiple diagnostic categories. To address this limitation, we paired an unsupervised multimodal canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) together with joint independent component analysis (jICA) to identify linked spatial gray matter (GM), resting-state functional network connectivity (FNC), and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) features across these diagnostic categories. We then calculated associations between the identified linked features and trans-diagnostic behavioral measures (MATRICs Consensus Cognitive Battery, MCCB). Component number 4 of the 13 identified displayed a statistically significant relationship with overall MCCB scores across GM, resting-state FNC, and FA. These linked modalities of component 4 consisted primarily of positive correlations within subcortical structures including the caudate and putamen in the GM maps with overall MCCB, sparse negative correlations within subcortical and cortical connection tracts (e.g., corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus) in the FA maps with overall MCCB, and negative relationships with MCCB values and loading parameters with FNC matrices displaying increased FNC in subcortical-cortical regions with auditory, somatomotor, and visual regions.	193	137	56	patient groups: 90+10+37	53	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion (using GIG-ICA?)), physiological (nuisance covariate regression (using GIG-ICA?)) 	no		information on data processing not very clear.

Performance on sustained attention paradigms such as continuous perfor-mance tasks are influenced by both the ability to sustain attention and response strategy. However, previous studies have not dissociated PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability and strategy, which limits characterization of neural circuitry underlying PTSD-related attentional impairments. Therefore, we character-ized and replicated PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability and response strategy in trauma -exposed Veterans, which guided characterization of PTSD-related differences in neural circuit function. In Study 1, PTSD symptoms were selectively associated with reduced sustained attention ability, but not more impulsive response strategies. In Study 2, we utilized task and resting-state fMRI to characterize neural circuitry underlying PTSD-related differences in sustained attention ability. Both PTSD symptomatology and sustained attention ability exhibited converging associations with reduced dorsal attention network (DAN) synchronization to endogeneous attentional fluctuations. Post-hoc time course analyses demonstrated that PTSD symptoms were most accurately characterized by delayed, rather than globally reduced, DAN synchronization to endogenous attentional fluctuations. Together, these findings suggest that PTSD symptomatology may selectively impair sustained attention ability by disrupting proactive engagement of attentional control circuitry.	117	117	NA	NA	200	7	correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion, linear scanner drift), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering, global signal regression) 	no			- 200 parcels and 7 networks  - no explicit information on edge selection or modelling

The reconstruction of language function depends on the hierarchical whole-brain dynamic reorganization. However, investigations into the longitudinal neural changes of large-scale brain networks for poststroke aphasia remain scarce. Here we characterize large-scale brain dy-namics in left-frontal-stroke aphasia through energy landscape analysis. Using fMRI during an auditory comprehension task, we find that aphasia patients suffer serious whole-brain dynamics perturbation in the acute and subacute stages after stroke, in which the brains were restricted into two major activity patterns. Following spontaneous recovery process, the brain flexibility improved in the chronic stage. Critically, we demonstrated that the abnormal neural dynamics are correlated with the aberrant brain network coordination. Taken together, the energy landscape analysis exhibited that the acute poststroke aphasia has a constrained, low dimensional brain dynamics, which were replaced by less constrained and high dimensional dynamics at chronic aphasia. Our study provides a new perspective to profoundly understand the pathological mechanisms of poststroke aphasia.	33	16	17	NA	131	9	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression) 	no			"- 313 nodes and 9 networks  - no mention of edge selection - information taken from here but unsure whether this pertains to what we want to find out: ""For each individual, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the average network activities, that is, the global functional connectivity of nine networks we focused on.

In animal models, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to facilitate neuroplasticity. This is especially prominent during emotional relearning, such as fear extinction, which may translate to clinical improvements in patients. To investigate a comparable modulation of neuroplasticity in humans, 99 healthy subjects underwent three weeks of emotional (matching faces) or non-emotional learn-ing (matching Chinese characters to unrelated German nouns). Shuffled pairings of the original content were subsequently relearned for the same time. During relearning, subjects received either a daily dose of the SSRI escitalopram or placebo. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after the (re-)learning phases. FC changes in a network comprising Broca's area, the medial prefrontal cortex, the right inferior temporal and left lingual gyrus were modulated by escitalopram intake. More specifically, it increased the bidirectional connectivity between medial prefrontal cortex and lingual gyrus for non-emotional and the connectivity from medial prefrontal cortex to Broca's area for emotional relearning. The context dependence of these effects together with behavioral correlations supports the assumption that SSRIs in clinical practice improve neuroplasticity rather than psychiatric symptoms per se. Beyond expanding the complexities of learning, these findings emphasize the influence of external factors on human neuroplasticity.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Mind-wandering often includes spontaneous, nonintentional thought, and a neural correlate of this kind of thought is the default mode network (DMN). Thoughts during mind-wandering can have positive or negative valence, but only little is known about the neural correlates of positive or negative thoughts. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and music to evoke mind-wandering in n = 33 participants, with positive-sounding music eliciting thoughts with more positive valence and negative-sounding music eliciting thoughts with more negative valence. Applying purely data-driven analysis methods, we show that medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC, part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and the posterior cingulate sulcus (likely area 23c of the posterior cingulate cortex), two sub-regions of the DMN, modulate the valence of thought-contents during mind-wandering. In addition, across two independent experiments, we observed that the posterior cingulate sulcus, a region involved in pain, shows valence-specific functional connectivity with core regions of the brain's putative pain network. Our results suggest that two DMN regions (mOFC and posterior cingulate sulcus) support the formation of negative spontaneous, nonintentional thoughts, and that the interplay between these structures with regions of the putative pain network forms a neural mechanism by which thoughts can become painful."														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- wrong outcome (analysis)  - no network built  - no mention of association, or network size, seem to model functional connectivity for only one region? unclear paper 			can be included, alexandra double check what I added in red please - because this coherence measure was used, weigthing and thresholding is not a thing

Cognitive and sensory parameters of joint action-such as shared knowledge or temporal (a)synchrony-influence this coordination by shifting the balance between self-other segregation and integration. To investigate the neural bases of these parameters and their interaction during joint action, we asked pianists to play on an MR-compatible piano, in duet with a partner outside of the scanner room. Motor knowledge of the partner's musical part and the temporal compatibility of the partner's action feedback were manipulated. First, we found stronger activity and functional connectivity within cortico-cerebellar audio-motor networks when pianists had practiced their partner's part before. This indicates that they simulated and anticipated the auditory feedback of the partner by virtue of an internal model. Second, we observed stronger cerebellar activity and reduced behavioral adaptation when pianists encountered subtle asynchronies between these model-based anticipations and the perceived sensory outcome of (familiar) partner actions, indicating a shift towards self-other segregation. These combined findings demonstrate that cortico-cerebellar audio-motor networks link motor knowledge and other-produced sounds depending on cognitive and sensory factors of the joint performance, and play a crucial role in balancing self-other integration and segregation.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Using a visual perception task, we directly recorded a subcortical thalamic awareness potential (TAP). We also developed a unique paradigm to classify perceived versus not perceived stimuli using eye measurements to remove confounding signals related to reporting on conscious experiences. Using fMRI, we discovered three major brain networks driving conscious visual perception independent of report: first, increases in signal detection regions in visual, fusiform cortex, and frontal eye fields; and in arousal/salience networks involving midbrain, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate, and anterior insula; second, increases in frontoparietal attention and executive control networks and in the cerebellum; finally, decreases in the default mode network. These results were largely maintained after excluding eye movement-based fMRI changes. Our findings provide evidence that the neurophysiology of consciousness is complex even without overt report, involving multiple cortical and subcortical networks overlapping in space and time. Isolating the neural mechanisms of consciousness is complicated by task report and other irrelevant signals. Here, the authors removed report and eye movement confounds to uncover large scale cortical-subcortical networks specific for human visual consciousness.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?		no

The effect of hunger state on hypothalamic functional connectivity in response to food cues	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	The neural underpinnings of the integration of internal and external cues that reflect nutritional status are poorly understood in humans. The hypothalamus is a key integrative area involved in short- and long-term energy intake regulation. Hence, we examined the effect of hunger state on the hypothalamus network using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a multicenter study, participants performed a food cue viewing task either fasted or sated on two separate days. We evaluated hypothalamic functional connectivity (FC) using psychophysiological interactions during high versus low caloric food cue viewing in 107 adults (divided into four groups based on age and body mass index [BMI]; age range 24-76 years; BMI range 19.5-41.5 kg/m(2)). In the sated compared to the fasted condition, the hypothalamus showed significantly higher FC with the bilateral caudate, the left insula and parts of the left inferior frontal cortex. Interestingly, we observed a significant interaction between hunger state and BMI group in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Participants with normal weight compared to overweight and obesity showed higher FC between the hypothalamus and DLPFC in the fasted condition. The current study showed that task-based FC of the hypothalamus can be modulated by internal (hunger state) and external cues (i.e., food cues with varying caloric content) with a general enhanced communication in the sated state and obesity-associated differences in hypothalamus to DLPFC communication. This could potentially promote overeating in persons with obesity.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		PPI

Not only does the act of collecting data at multiple sites generally increase sample sizes (a critical point in machine learning development) it also generates a more heterogeneous dataset due to systematic differences in scanners at different sites, and geographical differences in patient populations. As part of the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND-1) study, 144 MDD patients from six sites underwent resting state fMRI prior to starting escitalopram treatment, and again two weeks after the start. Here, we consider ways to use machine learning techniques to produce models that can predict response (measured at eight weeks after initiation), based on various parcellations, functional connec-tivity (FC) metrics, dimensionality reduction algorithms, and base learners, and also whether to use scans from one or both time points. Models that use only baseline (pre-treatment) or only week 2 (early-response) whole -brain FC features consistently failed to perform significantly better than default models. Utilizing the change in FC between these two time points, however, yielded significant results, with the best performing analytical pipeline achieving 69.6% (SD 10.8) accuracy. These results appear contrary to findings from many smaller single-site studies, which report substantially higher predictive accuracies from models trained on only baseline resting state FC features, suggesting these models may not generalize well beyond data used for development. Further, these results indicate the potential value of collecting data both before and shortly after treatment initiation.	144	144	NA	NA	121	NA	multiple	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression to remove cardiac/respiration artifacts, low-pass filtering)	no			- association: full correlation, partial correlation, tangent (optimised covariance learning) - multiple parcellations (average taken for concept): 116,160,48,264,17 - no mentions of weights, edge selection, and level of modelling

Transient, developmental functional and structural connectivity abnormalities in the thalamocortical motor network in Rolandic epilepsy	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common focal, idiopathic, developmental epilepsy, characterized by a transient period of sleep-potentiated seizures and epileptiform discharges in the inferior Rolandic cortex during childhood. The cause of RE remains unknown but converging evidence has identified abnormalities in the Rolandic thalamocortical circuit. To better localize this transient disease, we evaluated Rolandic thalamocortical functional and structural connectivity in the sensory and motor circuits separately during the symptomatic and asymptomatic phases of this disease. We collected high resolution structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI data in a prospective cohort of children with active RE (n = 17), resolved RE (n = 21), and controls (n = 33). We then computed the functional and structural connectivity between the inferior Rolandic cortex and the ventrolateral (VL) nucleus of the thalamus (efferent pathway) and the ventroposterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus (afferent pathway) across development in children with active, resolved RE and controls. We compared connectivity with age in each group using linear mixed-effects models. We found that children with active RE have increasing thalamocortical functional connectivity between the VL thalamus and inferior motor cortex with age (p = 0.022) that is not observed in controls or resolved RE. In contrast, children with resolved RE have increasing thalamocortical structural connectivity between the VL nucleus and the inferior motor cortex with age (p = 0.025) that is not observed in controls or active RE. No relationships were identified between VPL nuclei and the inferior sensory cortex with age in any group. These findings localize the functional and structural thalamocortical circuit disruption in RE to the efferent thalamocortical motor pathway. Further work is required to determine how these circuit abnormalities contribute to the emergence and resolution of symptoms in this developmental disease.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- seed to voxel analysis with 2 seeds  - not specified edge weights - edge selection: ""To reduce the influence of extreme observations, we applied a logarithmic transformation to all connectivity measures.

Here, given the importance of nonlocal and diffuse damage, we use an edge-centric approach to functional connectivity in order to provide an alternative description of the effects of this disorder. These techniques allow for the rendering of metrics such as normalized entropy, which describes the diversity of edge communities at each node. Moreover, the approach enables the identification of high amplitude co-fluctuations in fMRI time series. We found that normalized entropy is associated with stroke lesion severity and continually increases across the time of patients' recovery. Furthermore, high amplitude co-fluctuations not only relate to the lesion severity but are also associated with patients' level of recovery. The current study is the first edge-centric application for a clinical population in a longitudinal dataset and demonstrates how a different perspective for functional data analysis can further characterize topographic modulations of brain dynamics.	123	96	27	- second cohort: n= 10 (patient)+10(HC)	235	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (normalised entropy and high amplitude co-fluctuations)	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: age (sample matching), other (education (sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering, global signal regression) 	no			"- edges seem to have been selected using ""Edge-centric calculations: Normalized entropy and high amplitude co-fluctuations"" but not entirely clear what they are doing there "

Here, we proposed a new principal component analysis (PCA) approach to study variations in functional connectivity, focusing on major hubs of the salience network and default mode network, namely the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. We analyzed the intersubject variability of human functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity obtained from healthy, autistic, and schizophrenic subjects. Utilizing data from 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, COBRE, and ABIDE 1 database, we characterized the normal variations of the cingulate cortices with respect to top PCA dimensions. We showed that functional connectivity variations of the 2 cingulate cortices are constrained, in a parallel manner, by competing or cooperating interactions with different sensorimotor, associative, and limbic networks. In schizophrenic and autistic subjects, diffuse and subtle network changes along the same dimensions were found, which suggest significant behavioral implications of the variational dimensions. Furthermore, we showed that individual dynamic functional connectivity tends to fluctuate along the principal components of connectivity variations across individuals. Our results demonstrate the strength of this new approach in addressing the intrinsic variations of network connectivity in human brain and identifying their subtle changes in neuropsychiatric disorders.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Integrating multiple brain imaging modalities does not boost prediction of subclinical atherosclerosis in midlife adults	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Background: Human neuroimaging evidence suggests that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk may relate to functional and structural features of the brain. The present study tested whether combining functional and structural (multimodal) brain measures, derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), would yield a multivariate brain biomarker that reliably predicts a subclinical marker of CVD risk, carotid-artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT). Methods: Neuroimaging, cardiovascular, and demographic data were assessed in 324 midlife and otherwise healthy adults who were free of (a) clinical CVD and (b) use of medications for chronic illnesses (aged 30-51 years, 49% female). We implemented a prediction stacking algorithm that combined multimodal brain imaging measures and Framingham Risk Scores (FRS) to predict CA-IMT. We included imaging measures that could be easily obtained in clinical settings: resting state functional connectivity and structural morphology measures from T1-weighted images. Results: Our models reliably predicted CA-IMT using FRS, as well as for several individual MRI measures; however, none of the individual MRI measures outperformed FRS. Moreover, stacking functional and structural brain measures with FRS did not boost prediction accuracy above that of FRS alone. Conclusions: Combining multimodal functional and structural brain measures through a stacking algorithm does not appear to yield a reliable brain biomarker of subclinical CVD, as reflected by CA-IMT.	324	NA	324	NA	200	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering)	no			#NAAM?

Visuomotor brain network activation and functional connectivity among individuals with autism spectrum disorder	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Sensorimotor abnormalities are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and predictive of functional outcomes, though their neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined both brain activation and functional connectivity during visuomotor behavior in 27 individuals with ASD and 30 typically developing (TD) controls (ages 9-35 years). Participants maintained a constant grip force while receiving visual feedback at three different visual gain levels. Relative to controls, ASD participants showed increased force variability, especially at high gain, and reduced entropy. Brain activation was greater in individuals with ASD than controls in supplementary motor area, bilateral superior parietal lobules, and contralateral middle frontal gyrus at high gain. During motor action, functional connectivity was reduced between parietal-premotor and parietal-putamen in individuals with ASD compared to controls. Individuals with ASD also showed greater age-associated increases in functional connectivity between cerebellum and visual, motor, and prefrontal cortical areas relative to controls. These results indicate that visuomotor deficits in ASD are associated with atypical activation and functional connectivity of posterior parietal, premotor, and striatal circuits involved in translating sensory feedback information into precision motor behaviors, and that functional connectivity of cerebellar-cortical sensorimotor and nonsensorimotor networks show delayed maturation.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

However, how these regions cooperate with the reading-related areas in the cerebrum remains unclear. Here, brain images of fifty-two adults were acquired via functional magnetic resonance imaging. By comparing the cerebellar activation across three localization tasks targeting orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing, we first identified three different reading-related areas in the cerebellum, biased toward orthography, phonology, and semantics, respectively. Then, functional connectivity (FC) analyses demonstrated that the mean FC between functionally corresponding areas across the cerebrum and cerebellum was greater than that between noncorresponding areas during silent word reading. FC patterns of functionally corresponding areas could significantly predict reading speed, with the FC driven from orthographic and semantic areas contributing the most. Effective FC analyses further showed that orthographic and semantic areas in the cerebellum had selective and direct connectivity to areas in the cerebrum with similar functional specificity. These results suggest that reading-related areas vary in their functions to reading, and cooperation between areas with corresponding functions was greater than that between noncorresponding areas. These findings emphasize the importance of functional cooperation between the cerebrum and cerebellum during reading from a new perspective.	52	NA	52	NA	6	NA	correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (differences in ROI size across the brain, hemodynamic lag (during fMRI task)) after: clinical/psychological (task performance)	no			#NAAM?

The disorder is characterized by aberrant neural networks interacting with environment and genetics. Dissecting the neural substrates and functional networks that relate to longitudinal changes in alcohol use from those that relate to alcohol misuse cross-sectionally is important to elucidate therapeutic approaches.METHODS: To assess how neuroimaging data, including T1, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging, relate to alcohol misuse cross-sectionally and longitudinally in the UK Biobank, this study analyzed range of alcohol misuse in a population-based normative sample of 24,784 participants, ages 45 to 81 years old, in a cross-sectional analysis and a sample of 3070 participants in a longitudinal analysis 2 years later.RESULTS: Cross-sectional analysis showed that alcohol use is associated with a reduction in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex gray matter concentration and functional resting-state connectivity (nodal degree: t24,422 =-12.99, p , 1 3 10-17). Reduced dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/ dorsomedial prefrontal cortex functional connections to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and striatum relate to greater alcohol use. In a longitudinal analysis, higher resting-state nodal degree (t3036 =-3.27, p = .0011) and T1 gray matter concentration in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex relate to reduced alcohol intake frequency 2 years later. Higher ventromedial prefrontal cortex and frontoparietal executive network functional connectivity is associated with lower subsequent drinking longitudinally.CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal versus ventromedial prefrontal regions are differentially related to alcohol misuse cross -sectionally or longitudinally in a large UK Biobank normative dataset. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological substrates of alcohol use as a state or prospectively, thereby providing potential targets for clinical treatment.	24784	NA	NA	second sample: 3070	625	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (multiple)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological noise.  after: age, gender, physiological/biological (intracranial volume), other (study site)	no			#NAAM?	voxelwise regression with behavioural score, not a group network but individual voxelwise maps are fed into linear regression analysis. 	no

A sub plus cortical fMRI-based surface parcellation	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Both cortical and subcortical structures are organized into a large number of distinct areas reflecting functional and cytoarchitectonic differences. Mapping these areas is of fundamental importance to neuroscience. A central obstacle to this task is the inaccuracy associated with bringing results from individuals into a common space. The vast individual differences in morphology pose a serious problem for volumetric registration. Surface-based approaches fare substantially better, but have thus far been used only for cortical parcellation, leaving subcortical parcellation in volumetric space. We extend the surface-based approach to include also the subcortical deep gray-matter structures, thus achieving a uniform representation across both cortex and subcortex, suitable for use with surface-based metrics that span these structures, for example, white/gray contrast. Using data from the Enhanced Nathan Klein Institute-Rockland Sample, limited to individuals between 19 and 69 years of age, we generate a functional parcellation of both the cortical and subcortical surfaces. To assess this extended parcellation, we show that (a) our parcellation provides greater homogeneity of functional connectivity patterns than do arbitrary parcellations matching in the number and size of parcels; (b) our parcels align with known cortical and subcortical architecture; and (c) our extended functional parcellation provides an improved fit to the complexity of life-span (6-85 years) changes in white/gray contrast data compared to arbitrary parcellations matching in the number and size of parcels, supporting its use with surface-based measures. We provide our extended functional parcellation for the use of the neuroimaging community.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- wrong outcome (analysis)   - comparison of parcellations, no network built

However, the role of S1 plasticity in postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) remains elusive. Combining psychophysics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we investigated whether pain in PHN patients is linked to S1 reorganization as compared with healthy controls. Results from voxel-based morphometry showed no structural differences between groups. To characterize functional plasticity, we compared S1 responses to noxious laser stimuli of a fixed intensity between both groups and assessed the relationship between S1 activation and spontaneous pain in PHN patients. Although the intensity of evoked pain was comparable in both groups, PHN patients exhibited greater activation in S1 ipsilateral to the stimulated hand. Pain-related activity was identified in contralateral superior S1 (SS1) in controls as expected, but in bilateral inferior S1 (IS1) in PHN patients with no overlap between SS1 and IS1. Contralateral SS1 engaged during evoked pain in controls encoded spontaneous pain in patients, suggesting functional S1 reorganization in PHN. Resting-state fMRI data showed decreased functional connectivity between left and right SS1 in PHN patients, which scaled with the intensity of spontaneous pain. Finally, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) demonstrated that BOLD activity and resting-state functional connectivity of S1 predicted within-subject variations of evoked and spontaneous pain intensities across groups. In summary, functional reorganization in S1 might play a key role in chronic pain related to PHN and could be a potential treatment target in this patient group.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- unclear if network was constructed, difficult to extract information 		seed-based

However, it remains unclear how the 2 collaborate in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. With functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, we compared cerebrocerebellar functional connectivity during the resting state (rsFC) between the aMCI and healthy control (HC) groups. Additionally, we distinguished coupling between functionally corresponding and noncorresponding areas across the cerebrum and cerebellum. The results demonstrated decreased rsFC between both functionally corresponding and noncorresponding areas, suggesting distributed deficits of cerebrocerebellar connections in aMCI patients. Increased rsFC was also observed, which were between functionally noncorresponding areas. Moreover, the increased rsFC was positively correlated with attentional scores in the aMCI group, and this effect was absent in the HC group, supporting that there exists a compensatory mechanism in patients. The current study contributes to illustrating how the cerebellum adjusts its coupling with the cerebrum in individuals with cognitive impairment.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		unclear if network was built 	Seed-based analysis (seed to voxel) as well as ROI to ROI analysis. 	seed-based

Anterior dorsal attention network tau drives visual attention deficits in posterior cortical atrophy	BRAIN	Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), usually an atypical clinical syndrome of Alzheimer's disease, has well-characterized patterns of cortical atrophy and tau deposition that are distinct from typical amnestic presentations of Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the cortical spread of tau in PCA remain unclear. Here, in a sample of 17 biomarker-confirmed (A+/T+/N+) individuals with PCA, we sought to identify functional networks with heightened vulnerability to tau pathology by examining the cortical distribution of elevated tau as measured by F-18-flortaucipir (FTP) PET. We then assessed the relationship between network-specific FTP uptake and visuospatial cognitive task performance. As predicted, we found consistent and prominent localization of tau pathology in the dorsal attention network and visual network of the cerebral cortex. Elevated FTP uptake within the dorsal attention network (particularly the ratio of FTP uptake between the anterior and posterior nodes) was associated with poorer visuospatial attention in PCA; associations were also identified in other functional networks, although to a weaker degree. Furthermore, using functional MRI data collected from each patient at wakeful rest, we found that a greater anterior-to-posterior ratio in FTP uptake was associated with stronger intrinsic functional connectivity between anterior and posterior nodes of the dorsal attention network. Taken together, we conclude that our cross-sectional marker of anterior-to-posterior FTP ratio could indicate tau propagation from posterior to anterior dorsal attention network nodes, and that this anterior progression occurs in relation to intrinsic functional connectivity within this network critical for visuospatial attention. Our findings help to clarify the spatiotemporal pattern of tau propagation in relation to visuospatial cognitive decline and highlight the key role of the dorsal attention network in the disease progression of PCA.	17	17	NA	NA	400	7	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (low-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression)  after: age, sex	no			#NAAM?

As important signalling molecules and mediators of many neurobiological interactions, neurotransmitter receptors are promising candidates for identifying molecular mechanisms and drug targets in Alzheimer's disease. We present a neurotransmitter receptor-enriched multifactorial brain model, which integrates spatial distribution patterns of 15 neurotransmitter receptors from post-mortem autoradiography with multiple in vivo neuroimaging modalities (tau, amyloid-beta and glucose PET, and structural, functional and arterial spin labelling MRI) in a personalized, generative, whole-brain formulation. In a heterogeneous aged population (n = 423, ADNI data), models with personalized receptor-neuroimaging interactions showed a significant improvement over neuroimaging-only models, explaining about 70% (+/- 20%) of the variance in longitudinal changes to the six neuroimaging modalities. In Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 25, ADNI data), receptor-imaging interactions explained up to 39.7% (P < 0.003, family-wise error-rate-corrected) of inter-individual variability in cognitive deterioration, via an axis primarily affecting executive function. Notably, based on their contribution to the clinical severity in Alzheimer's disease, we found significant functional alterations to glutamatergic interactions affecting tau accumulation and neural activity dysfunction and GABAergic interactions concurrently affecting neural activity dysfunction, amyloid and tau distributions, as well as significant cholinergic receptor effects on tau accumulation. Overall, GABAergic alterations had the largest effect on cognitive impairment (particularly executive function) in our Alzheimer's disease cohort (n = 25). Furthermore, we demonstrate the clinical applicability of this approach by characterizing subjects based on individualized 'fingerprints' of receptor alterations. This study introduces the first robust, data-driven framework for integrating several neurotransmitter receptors, multimodal neuroimaging and clinical data in a flexible and interpretable brain model. It enables further understanding of the mechanistic neuropathological basis of neurodegenerative progression and heterogeneity, and constitutes a promising step towards implementing personalized, neurotransmitter-based treatments.	423	274	149	- fCN calculated for n=42 HC - total sample was n= 423 (149HC, 151 MCI, 103 late MCI, 20 AD)	88	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering) after: age, gender, other (education)	no			#NAAM?

The locus coeruleus is the initial site of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, with hyperphosphorylated Tau appearing in early adulthood followed by neurodegeneration in dementia. Locus coeruleus dysfunction contributes to Alzheimer's pathobiology in experimental models, which can be rescued by increasing norepinephrine transmission. To test norepinephrine augmentation as a potential disease-modifying therapy, we performed a biomarker-driven phase II trial of atomoxetine, a clinically-approved norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, in subjects with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. The design was a single-centre, 12-month double-blind crossover trial. Thirty-nine participants with mild cognitive impairment and biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease were randomized to atomoxetine or placebo treatment. Assessments were collected at baseline, 6- (crossover) and 12-months (completer). Target engagement was assessed by CSF and plasma measures of norepinephrine and metabolites. Prespecified primary outcomes were CSF levels of IL1 alpha and TECK. Secondary/exploratory outcomes included clinical measures, CSF analyses of amyloid-beta(42), Tau, and pTau(181), mass spectrometry proteomics and immune-based targeted inflammation-related cytokines, as well as brain imaging with MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET. Baseline demographic and clinical measures were similar across trial arms. Dropout rates were 5.1% for atomoxetine and 2.7% for placebo, with no significant differences in adverse events. Atomoxetine robustly increased plasma and CSF norepinephrine levels. IL-1 alpha and TECK were not measurable in most samples. There were no significant treatment effects on cognition and clinical outcomes, as expected given the short trial duration. Atomoxetine was associated with a significant reduction in CSF Tau and pTau(181) compared to placebo, but not associated with change in amyloid-beta(42). Atomoxetine treatment also significantly altered CSF abundances of protein panels linked to brain pathophysiologies, including synaptic, metabolism and glial immunity, as well as inflammation-related CDCP1, CD244, TWEAK and osteoprotegerin proteins. Treatment was also associated with significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and reduced triglycerides in plasma. Resting state functional MRI showed significantly increased inter-network connectivity due to atomoxetine between the insula and the hippocampus. Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET showed atomoxetine-associated increased uptake in hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal pole, inferior temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, with carry-over effects 6 months after treatment. In summary, atomoxetine treatment was safe, well tolerated and achieved target engagement in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Atomoxetine significantly reduced CSF Tau and pTau, normalized CSF protein biomarker panels linked to synaptic function, brain metabolism and glial immunity, and increased brain activity and metabolism in key temporal lobe circuits. Further study of atomoxetine is warranted for repurposing the drug to slow Alzheimer's disease progression.	36	NA	NA	NA	53	NA	full correlation	aggregated	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion) after: age, gender, biological (BMI), other (baseline static FC values). 	no

The network representation of functional connectivity, called a functional connectome (FC), has been shown to contain an individual fingerprint allowing participants identification across consecutive testing sessions. Recently, researchers have focused on the extraction of these fingerprints, with potential applications in personalized medicine. Materials and Methods: In this study, we show that a mathematical operation denominated degree-normalization can improve the extraction of FC fingerprints. Degree-normalization has the effect of reducing the excessive influence of strongly connected brain areas in the whole-brain network. We adopt the differential identifiability framework and apply it to both original and degree-normalized FCs of 409 individuals from the Human Connectome Project, in resting-state and 7 fMRI tasks. Results: Our results indicate that degree-normalization systematically improves three fingerprinting metrics, namely differential identifiability, identification rate, and matching rate. Moreover, the results related to the matching rate metric suggest that individual fingerprints are embedded in a low-dimensional space. Discussion: The results suggest that low-dimensional functional fingerprints lie in part in weakly connected sub-networks of the brain and that degree-normalization helps uncovering them. This work introduces a simple mathematical operation that could lead to significant improvements in future FC fingerprinting studies.	409	NA	NA	NA	374	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, global signal regression) after: other (matching rate)	no

However, most research on biased emotional perception in depression has only focused on unimodal experimental stimuli, the neural basis of potentially biased emotional processing of multimodal inputs remains unclear. Here, we addressed this issue by implementing an audiovisual emotional task during functional MRI scanning sessions with 37 patients with MDD and 37 gender-, age- and education-matched healthy controls. Participants were asked to distinguish laughing and crying sounds while being exposed to faces with different emotional valences as background. We combined general linear model and psychophysiological interaction analyses to identify abnormal local functional activity and integrative processes during audiovisual emotional processing in MDD patients. At the local neural level, MDD patients showed increased bias activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) while listening to negative auditory stimuli and concurrently processing visual facial expressions, along with decreased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity in both the positive and negative visual facial conditions. At the network level, MDD exhibited significantly decreased connectivity in areas involved in automatic emotional processes and voluntary control systems during perception of negative stimuli, including the vmPFC, dlPFC, insula, as well as the subcortical regions of posterior cingulate cortex and striatum. These findings support a multimodal emotion dysregulation hypothesis for MDD by demonstrating that negative bias effects may be facilitated by the excessive ventral bottom-up negative emotional influences along with incapability in dorsal prefrontal top-down control system.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

To better capture the heterogeneity of the symptoms of patients with PCS, we aimed to separate patients into clinical subtypes based on brain connectivity changes.Methods: Subject-specific structural and functional connectomes were created based on diffusion weighted and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Following an informed dimensionality reduction, a Gaussian mixture model was used on patient-specific structural and functional connectivity matrices to find potential patient clusters. For validation, the resulting patient subtypes were compared in terms of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and postconcussive symptom differences.Results: Multimodal analyses of brain connectivity were predictive of behavioral outcomes. Our modeling revealed two patient subtypes: mild and severe. The severe subgroup showed significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, aggression, and a greater number of symptoms than the mild patient subgroup.Conclusion: This study suggests that structural and functional connectivity changes together can help us better understand the symptom severity and neuropsychiatric profiles of patients with PCS. This work allows us to move toward precision medicine in concussions and provides a novel machine learning approach that can be applicable to other heterogeneous conditions. Impact statementStructural and functional brain connectivity of patients with postconcussion syndrome (PCS) are predictive of their behavioral outcomes. Taking a data-driven machine learning approach, we revealed two distinct clinical subtypes of patients: those with mild versus severe symptoms. Patients in the severe subtype reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, aggressive attitudes, and severe symptoms, whereas mild patients' symptom and brain connectivity profiles resemble healthy controls. This study does not only report clinical subtypes of PCS but also suggests that multimodal neuroimaging analysis of resting state and diffusion-weighted imaging together is more powerful than unimodal analyses in predicting neuropsychiatric symptoms and symptom severity of patients.	96	83	13	#NAAM?	84	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), other (education (sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-AROMA denoising, band pass filtering) after: age (edges corrected using a linear model)	no		"Deconfounding performed in an intermediate step after network estimation but before statistical analysis:  ""each connection was corrected for age with a linear model by taking its residuals"""	#NAAM?

However, most studies in depression have focused on unimodal emotion processing, whereas emotional perception in daily life is highly dependent on multimodal sensory inputs. Here, we proposed a novel multilevel discriminative framework to identify the altered neural patterns in processing audiovisual emotion in MDD. Seventy-four participants underwent an audiovisual emotional task functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Three levels of whole-brain functional features were extracted for each subject, including the task-evoked activation, task-modulated connectivity, combined activation and connectivity. Support vector machine classification and prediction models were built to identify MDD from controls and evaluate clinical relevance. We revealed that complex neural networks including the emotion regulation network (prefrontal areas and limbic-subcortical regions) and the multisensory integration network (lateral temporal cortex and motor areas) had the discriminative power. Moreover, by integrating comprehensive information of local and interactive processes, multilevel models could lead to a substantial increase in classification accuracy and depression severity prediction. Together, we highlight the high representational capacity of machine learning algorithms to characterize the complex network abnormalities associated with emotional regulation and multisensory integration in MDD. These findings provide novel evidence for the neural mechanisms underlying multimodal emotion dysregulation of depression.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		PPI

Utilizing such models, we found common and specific neurodevelopmental abnormalities in multiband functional brain networks between major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCH), and the abnormalities cannot be uncovered by individually analyzing brain networks within each frequency interval. These findings have important implications for understanding shared and unique neural mechanisms underlying MDD and SCH and highlight the necessity of integrating connectivity information from different frequency intervals to search for new biomarkers of the diseases. Introduction: Both major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCH) are characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities; however, transdiagnostic and diagnosis-specific patterns of such abnormalities have rarely been examined, particularly in large-scale functional brain networks via advanced multilayer network models.Methods: Here, we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 45 MDD patients, 64 SCH patients, and 48 healthy controls (HCs; 13-45 years old), and we constructed functional networks in different frequency intervals. The frequency-dependent networks were then fused by multiplex network models, followed by graph-based topological analyses.Results: We found that functional networks of the patients showed common neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the right ventromedial parietooccipital sulcus (opposite correlations with age to HCs), whereas functional networks of the MDD patients exhibited specific alterations in the left superior parietal lobule and right precentral gyrus with respect to cross-frequency interactions. These findings were quite different from those from brain networks within each frequency interval, which revealed SCH-specific neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the right superior temporal gyrus (opposite correlations with age to the other two groups) in 0.027-0.073 Hz, and SCH-specific alterations in the left superior temporal gyrus and bilateral insula in 0.073-0.198 Hz. Finally, multivariate analysis of age prediction revealed that the subcortical network lost prediction ability in both patient groups, whereas the visual network exhibited additional prediction ability in the MDD patients.Discussion and Conclusion: Altogether, these findings demonstrate transdiagnostic and diagnosis-specific neurodevelopmental abnormalities and alterations in large-scale functional brain networks between MDD and SCH, which have important implications for understanding shared and unique neural mechanisms underlying the diseases.	157	109	48	- patient sample: 45 MDD+64 SCH	246	NA	correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (band-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression) after: sex, scan related (motion), other (education)	no

Although a large body of task-based brain imaging measures has shed light on the neural underpinnings of reciprocity at group level, the neural basis underlying the individual differences in reciprocity propensity remains largely unclear. Here, we combined brain imaging and machine learning techniques to individually predict reciprocity propensity from resting-state brain activity measured by fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation. The brain regions contributing to the prediction were then analyzed for functional connectivity and decoding analyses, allowing for a data-driven quantitative inference on psychophysiological functions. Our results indicated that patterns of resting-state brain activity across multiple brain systems were capable of predicting individual reciprocity propensity, with the contributing regions distributed across the salience (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), fronto-parietal (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), default mode (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex), and sensorimotor (e.g., supplementary motor area) networks. Those contributing brain networks are implicated in emotion and cognitive control, mentalizing, and motor-based processes, respectively. Collectively, these findings provide novel evidence on the neural signatures underlying the individual differences in reciprocity, and lend support the assertion that reciprocity emerges from interactions among regions embodied in multiple large-scale brain networks.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

This study examined the association between the alterations in DMN FC, the changes of neurometabolites levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and the improvements in psychopathology in a longitudinal study of drug-naive first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients.Methods: Thirty-two drug-naive FEP patients and 30 matched healthy controls underwent repeated assessments with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, N-acetylaspartate in MPFC, and the FC of DMN were measured. After 8-week antipsychotic treatment, 24 patients were re-examined. Results: After treatment, the changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid were correlated with the alterations of FC between the MPFC and DMN, while the changes in N-acetyl-aspartate were associated with the alterations of FC between the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and DMN. The FC changes of both regions were correlated with patients PANSS positive score reductions. The structural equation modeling analyses revealed that the changes of DMN FC mediated the relationship between the changes of neurometabolites and the symptom improvements of the patients.Conclusions: The derived neurometabolic-functional changes underlying the clinical recovery provide insights into the prognosis of FEP patients. It is noteworthy that this is an exploratory study, and future work with larger sample size is needed to validate our findings.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- seed based with 4 seeds  - HC FC was binarized, therefore both weighted and unweighted included  - no mention of thresholding 		seed-based

Nevertheless, previous research on functional dysconnectivity has mainly focused on a single disorder and the transdiagnostic alterations in brain networks remain poorly understood. Hence, this study proposed a spatiotemporal constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (STCNMF) method based on real reference signals to extract large-scale brain networks to identify transdiagnostic changes in neurocognitive networks associated with multiple diseases. Available temporal prior information and spatial prior information were first mined from the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of group participants, and then these prior constraints were incorporated into the nonnegative matrix factorization objective functions to improve their efficiency. The algorithm successfully obtained 10 resting-state functional brain networks in fMRI data of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and healthy controls, and further found transdiagnostic changes in these large-scale networks, including enhanced connectivity between right frontoparietal network and default mode network, reduced connectivity between medial visual network and default mode network, and the presence of a few hyper-integrated network nodes. Besides, each type of psychiatric disorder had its specific connectivity characteristics. These findings provide new insights into transdiagnostic and diagnosis-specific neurobiological mechanisms for understanding multiple psychiatric disorders from the perspective of brain networks.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

However, FC findings have often been inconsistent, possibly due to a focus on static FC rather than brain dynamics. Lagged connectivity analyses aim at evaluating temporal latency, and presumably neural propagation, between regions. This approach may, therefore, reveal a more detailed picture of network organization in ASD than traditional FC methods.Methods: The current study evaluated whole-brain lag patterns in adolescents with ASD (n = 28) and their typically developing peers (n = 22). Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected during rest and during a lexico-semantic decision task. Optimal lag was calculated for each pair of regions of interest by using cross-covariance, and mean latency projections were calculated for each region.Results: Latency projections did not regionally differ between groups, with the same regions emerging among the ""earliest"" and ""latest."" Although many of the longest absolute latencies were preserved across resting-state and task conditions, lag patterns overall were affected by condition, as many regions shifted toward zero-lag during task performance. Lag structure was also strongly associated with literature-derived estimates of arterial transit time.Discussion: Results suggest that lag patterns are broadly typical in ASD but undergo changes during task performance. Moreover, lag patterns appear to reflect a combination of neural and vascular sources, which should be carefully considered when interpreting lagged FC. Impact statementAltered brain dynamics have been proposed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Lagged functional connectivity analysis uses cross-correlation between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series to determine regional latency. Few studies have examined blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) lag in ASD, and findings have been inconsistent. Using multi-echo fMRI data with improved artifact detection and removal, we find differences in lag structure between task and rest states, but not between adolescents with ASD and typically developing peers. Additional analyses exploring links with arterial transit time, however, highlight the impact of vascular organization on BOLD lag patterns and its potential to confound measures of neural dynamics."	50	28	22	NA	114	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering).  after: biological/physiological (evaluated relation with potential confounder ATT).  	no			"- no mention of weights or thresholds  - ""For each participant, time series were extracted from all ROIs.

We aim to explore the functional connectivity of aINS across wake and NREM sleep in the patients and to reveal the association between aINS connectivity and sleep discrepancy. Methods: Patients with insomnia disorder (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 31) underwent simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) during nighttime sleep, and aINS-based connectivity was calculated across wake and NREM sleep. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess the main effect of group and group-by-stage (wake, NREM stages 1-3) interaction effect on aINS connectivity. Similar mixed models were used to assess the potential correlation between aINS connectivity and the sleep misperception index (MI). Results: A significant group-by-stage interaction effect on aINS-based connectivity was observed in the bilateral frontal gyms, right inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral middle occipital gyrus and right postcentral gyms (p < 0.05, corrected). There was also a significant group-by-MI interaction effect on aINS connectivity with the putamen and thalamus during wakefulness (p < 0.05 corrected); MI was significantly associated with aINS-putamen/ thalamus connectivity in the control group, whereas the association was weak or even nonsignificant in the patient group. There was no significant main effect of group. Conclusion: The waking activity of a neural pathway containing the aINS, putamen, and thalamus may underlie sleep perception, potentially providing important perspectives to reveal complex mechanisms of sleep discrepancy between self-report and PSG.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- seed based  - no mention of edge selection in the network construction  - no explicit mention of level of modelling, most likely individual		seed-based

The brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) is a promising target for early diagnosis because of its early structural alterations and its relationship to the functional disturbances in the patients. In this study, we applied our improved method of localisation-based LC resting-state fMRI to investigate the differences in central sensory signal processing when comparing functional connectivity (fc) of a patient group with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 28) and an age-matched healthy control group (n = 29). MCI and control participants could be differentiated in their Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE) scores (p < .001) and LC intensity ratio (p = .010). In the fMRI, LC fc to anterior cingulate cortex (FDR p < .001) and left anterior insula (FDR p = .012) was elevated, and LC fc to right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ, FDR p = .012) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, FDR p = .021) was decreased in the patient group. Importantly, LC to rTPJ connectivity was also positively correlated to MMSE scores in MCI patients (p = .017). Furthermore, we found a hyperactivation of the left-insula salience network in the MCI patients. Our results and our proposed disease model shed new light on the functional pathogenesis of MCI by directing to attentional network disturbances, which could aid new therapeutic strategies and provide a marker for diagnosis and prediction of disease progression.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based

Given phenotypical overlaps between loneliness and social anxiety (SA), cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting SA might be adopted to reduce loneliness. However, whether SA and loneliness share the same underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is still an elusive question. The current study aimed at investigating to what extent known behavioral and neural correlates of social avoidance in SA are evident in loneliness. We used a prestratified approach involving 42 (21 females) participants with high loneliness (HL) and 40 (20 females) participants with low loneliness (LL) scores. During fMRI, participants completed a social gambling task to measure the subjective value of engaging in social situations and responses to social feedback. Univariate and multivariate analyses of behavioral and neural data replicated known task effects. However, although HL participants showed increased SA, loneliness was associated with a response pattern clearly distinct from SA. Specifically, contrary to expectations based on SA differences, Bayesian analyses revealed moderate evidence for equal subjective values of engaging in social situations and comparable amygdala responses to social decision-making and striatal responses to positive social feedback in both groups. Moreover, while explorative analyses revealed reduced pleasantness ratings, increased striatal activity, and decreased striatal-hippocampal connectivity in response to negative computer feedback in HL participants, these effects were diminished for negative social feedback. Our findings suggest that, unlike SA, loneliness is not associated with withdrawal from social interactions. Thus, established interventions for SA should be adjusted when targeting loneliness. Significance Statement Loneliness can cause serious health problems. Adapting well-established cognitive-behavioral therapies targeting social anxiety might be promising to reduce chronic loneliness given a close link between both constructs. However, a better understanding of behavioral and neurobiological factors associated with loneliness is needed to identify which specific mechanisms of social anxiety are shared by lonely individuals. We found that lonely individuals show a consistently distinct pattern of behavioral and neural responsiveness to social decision-making and social feedback compared with previous findings for social anxiety. Our results indicate that loneliness is associated with a biased emotional reactivity to negative events rather than social avoidance. Our findings thus emphasize the distinctiveness of loneliness from social anxiety and the need for adjusted psychotherapeutic protocols.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		PPI

Subtyping Autism Spectrum Disorder Via Joint Modeling of Clinical and Connectomic Profiles	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY	Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous developmental disorder with diverse clinical manifestations. Neuroimaging studies have explored functional connectivity (FC) of ASD through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies; however, the findings have remained inconsistent, thus reflecting the possibility of multiple subtypes. Identification of the relationship between clinical symptoms and FC measures may help clarify the inconsistencies in earlier findings and advance our understanding of ASD subtypes. Methods: Canonical correlation analysis was performed on 210 ASD subjects from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange to identify significant linear combinations of resting-state connectomic and clinical profiles of ASD. Then, hierarchical clustering defined ASD subtypes based on distinct brain-behavior relationships. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to verify that subtypes comprised subjects with distinct clinical and connectivity features. Results: Three ASD subtypes were identified. Subtype 1 exhibited increased intra-network FC, increased Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Subtype 2 was characterized by decreased whole-brain FC and more severe Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Social Responsiveness Scale symptoms. Subtype 3 demonstrated mixed FC, low IQ scores, as well as social motivation and verbal deficits. To verify subtype assignment, a multi-class SVM using connectomic and clinical profiles yielded an average accuracy of 71.3% and 65.2% respectively for subtype classification, which is significantly higher than chance (33.3%). Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that combining connectomic and behavioral measures is a powerful approach for disease subtyping and suggests that there are ASD subtypes with distinct connectomic and clinical profiles.	210	210	NA	all patients	200	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (correlation with behavioral outcomes)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance regression, band pass filtering). after: age, sex, clinical (comorbidity status, medication status), other (scan site). evaluated group differences  	no			#NAAM?

Genetic and environmental factors influencing neonatal resting-state functional connectivity	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used to identify complex brain networks by examining the correlation of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals between brain regions during the resting state. Many of the brain networks identified in adults are detectable at birth, but genetic and environmental influences governing connectivity within and between these networks in early infancy have yet to be explored. We investigated genetic influences on neonatal resting-state connectivity phenotypes by generating intraclass correlations and performing mixed effects modeling to estimate narrow-sense heritability on measures of within network and between-network connectivity in a large cohort of neonate twins. We also used backwards elimination regression and mixed linear modeling to identify specific demographic and medical history variables influencing within and between network connectivity in a large cohort of typically developing twins and singletons. Of the 36 connectivity phenotypes examined, only 6 showed narrow-sense heritability estimates greater than 0.10, with none being statistically significant. Demographic and obstetric history variables contributed to between- and within-network connectivity. Our results suggest that in early infancy, genetic factors minimally influence brain connectivity. However, specific demographic and medical history variables, such as gestational age at birth and maternal psychiatric history, may influence resting-state connectivity measures.	268	NA	NA	NA	90	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filter, global signal regression) after: scan related (motion, scnanner effects), sex	no

Their relationship to specific biochemical, psychophysical, and psychopathological changes remains unclear, though. For that purpose, we focus on a particular subregion in OC, namely middle temporal (MT) visual area that is known to mediate the perception of visual motion. Using high-field 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including resting state functional MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in MT, MT-seeded functional connectivity (FC), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in MT were investigated. Applying the vision motion psychophysical task, the motion suppression index of subjects was also examined. We demonstrate significantly elevated neural variability (as measured by ALFF) in MT together with decreases in both MT GABA and motion suppression in our MDD sample. Unlike in healthy subjects, MT neural variability no longer modulates the relationship of MT GABA and motion suppression in MDD. MT also exhibits reduction in global inter-regional FC to MPFC in MDD. Finally, elevated MT ALFF relates to specifically retardation in behavior as measured by the Hamilton subscore. Together, MT provides a strong candidate for biomarker in MDD.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based			
Liu, J and Grewen, K and Gao, W and Liu, Janelle and Grewen, Karen and Gao, Wei	Evidence for the Normalization Effects of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder on Functional Connectivity in Neonates with Prenatal Opioid Exposure	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	Altered functional connectivity has been reported in infants with prenatal exposure to opioids, which significantly interrupts and influences endogenous neurotransmitter/receptor signaling during fetal programming. Better birth outcomes and long-term developmental outcomes are associated with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during pregnancy, but the neural mechanisms underlying these benefits are largely unknown. We aimed to characterize effects of prenatal opioid/other drug exposure (PODE) and the neural basis for the reported beneficial effects of MOUD by examining neonatal brain func-tional organization. A cohort of 109 human newborns, 42 PODE, 39 with prenatal exposure to drugs excluding opioids (PDE), 28 drug-free controls (males and females) underwent resting-state fMRI at 2 weeks of age. To examine neural effects of MOUD, PODE infants were separated into subgroups based on whether mothers received MOUD (n = 31) or no treatment (n = 11). A novel heatmap analysis was designed to characterize PODE-associated functional connectivity alterations and MOUD-related effects, and permutation testing identified regions of interest with significant effects. PODE neonates showed alterations beyond those associated with PDE, particularly in reward-related frontal-sensory connectivity. MOUD was associ-ated with a significant reduction of PODE-related alterations in key regions of endogenous opioid pathways including limbic and frontal connections. However, significant residual effects in limbic and subcortical circuitry were observed. These findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with PODE. Importantly, widespread normalization effects associated with MOUD reveal, for the first time, the potential brain basis of the beneficial effects of MOUD on the developing brain and underscore the importance of this treatment intervention for better developmental outcomes.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based

Sustained upregulation of widespread hippocampal-neocortical coupling following memory encoding	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Systems consolidation of new experiences into lasting episodic memories involves hippocampal-neocortical interactions. Evidence of this process is already observed during early post-encoding rest periods, both as increased hippocampal coupling with task-relevant perceptual regions and reactivation of stimulus-specific patterns following intensive encoding tasks. We investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of these hippocampally anchored post-encoding neocortical modulations. Eighty-nine adults participated in an experiment consisting of interleaved memory task- and resting-state periods. We observed increased post-encoding functional connectivity between hippocampus and individually localized neocortical regions responsive to stimuli encountered during memory encoding. Post-encoding modulations were manifested as a nearly system-wide upregulation in hippocampal coupling with all major functional networks. The configuration of these extensive modulations resembled hippocampal-neocortical interaction patterns estimated from active encoding operations, suggesting hippocampal post-encoding involvement exceeds perceptual aspects. Reinstatement of encoding patterns was not observed in resting-state scans collected 12 h later, nor when using other candidate seed regions. The similarity in hippocampal functional coupling between online memory encoding and offline post-encoding rest suggests reactivation in humans involves a spectrum of cognitive processes engaged during the experience of an event. There were no age effects, suggesting that upregulation of hippocampal-neocortical connectivity represents a general phenomenon seen across the adult lifespan.	89	NA	89	NA	400	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filter), biological (ROI size differences across participants) after: scan related (motion)	no

Todd	A generalizable connectome-based marker of in-scan sustained attention in neurodiverse youth	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Difficulty with attention is an important symptom in many conditions in psychiatry, including neurodiverse conditions such as autism. There is a need to better understand the neurobiological correlates of attention and leverage these findings in healthcare settings. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if it is possible to build dimensional predictive models of attentional state in a sample that includes participants with neurodiverse conditions. Here, we use 5 datasets to identify and validate functional connectome-based markers of attention. In dataset 1, we use connectome-based predictive modeling and observe successful prediction of performance on an in-scan sustained attention task in a sample of youth, including participants with a neurodiverse condition. The predictions are not driven by confounds, such as head motion. In dataset 2, we find that the attention network model defined in dataset 1 generalizes to predict in-scan attention in a separate sample of neurotypical participants performing the same attention task. In datasets 3-5, we use connectome-based identification and longitudinal scans to probe the stability of the attention network across months to years in individual participants. Our results help elucidate the brain correlates of attentional state in youth and support the further development of predictive dimensional models of other clinically relevant phenotypes.	70	NA	NA	- testing sample (25) - three more samples to assess model reliability (n = 16,27,44)	268	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, MRI-related drift), physiological (global signal regression) after: scan related (motion), age (in additional analysis), sex (in additional analysis)	no			"- weights  - unclear if they binarized during network construction already or only for the regression model:  ""Combined network strengths = High network strengths – low network strengths where ... is the connectivity matrix for subject s and .... and .... are binary matrices indexing the edges ... that survived the feature selection threshold for the high or low network."""

Huang, ZY and Gao, WJ and Wu, ZW and Li, G and Nie, JX and Huang, Ziyi and Gao, Wenjian and Wu, Zhengwang and Li, Gang and Nie, Jingxin	Functional brain activity is highly associated with cortical myelination in neonates	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Functional organization of the human cerebral cortex is highly constrained by underlying brain structures, but how functional activity is associated with different brain structures during development is not clear, especially at the neonatal stage. Since long-range functional connectivity is far from mature in the dynamically developing neonatal brain, it is of great scientific significance to investigate the relationship between different structural and functional features at the local level. To this end, for the first time, correlation and regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between cortical morphology, cortical myelination, age, and local brain functional activity, as well as functional connectivity strength using high-resolution structural and resting-state functional MRI data of 177 neonates (29-44 postmenopausal weeks, 98 male and 79 female) from both static and dynamic perspectives. We found that cortical myelination was most strongly associated with local brain functional activity across the cerebral cortex than other cortical structural features while controlling the age effect. These findings suggest the crucial role of cortical myelination in local brain functional development at birth, providing valuable insights into the fundamental biological basis of functional activity at this early developmental stage.	177	NA	177	NA	200	NA	not specified	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes (absolutised)	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass and band-pass filtering, global signal regression) after: age (birth age), biological (birth weight), gender	no			#NAAM?

Neuroimaging can provide insights into brain morphology, functional organization, and vascular dynamics. However, most neuroimaging studies of aging have focused on each imaging modality separately, limiting the understanding of interrelations between processes identified by different modalities and their relevance to cognitive decline in aging. Here, we used a data-driven multimodal approach, linked independent component analysis (ICA), to jointly analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of grey matter volume, cerebrovascular, and functional network topographies in relation to measures of fluid intelligence. Neuroimaging and cognitive data from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience study were used, with healthy participants aged 18-88 years (main dataset n = 215 and secondary dataset n = 433). Using linked ICA, functional network activities were characterized in independent components but not captured in the same component as structural and cerebrovascular patterns. Split-sample (n = 108/107) and out-of-sample (n = 433) validation analyses using linked ICA were also performed. Global grey matter volume with regional cerebrovascular changes and the right frontoparietal network activity were correlated with age-related and individual differences in fluid intelligence. This study presents the insights from linked ICA to bring together measurements from multiple imaging modalities, with independent and additive information. We propose that integrating multiple neuroimaging modalities allows better characterization of brain pattern variability and changes associated with healthy aging.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- no network constructed, multimodal fusion with group ICA 			exclude - white matter functional networks - the focus is on very different data than all other papers

Being part of social groups constitutes a backbone for communal life and confers many benefits for the physical and mental health. Capitalizing on the neuroimaging and behavioral data from similar to 40,000 participants from the UK Biobank population cohort, we used structural and functional analyses to explore how social participation is reflected in the human brain. Across 3 different types of social groups, structural analyses point toward the variance in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex as structural substrates tightly linked to social participation. Functional connectivity analyses not only emphasized the importance of default mode and limbic network but also showed differences for sports teams and religious groups as compared to social clubs. Taken together, our findings establish the structural and functional integrity of the default mode network as a neural signature of social belonging.	40000	NA	40000	- sample was rounded to 40000	100	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filtering)  after: age, sex, scan related (head size, head motion, head and receiver coil position in scanner, position of scanner table), biological/physiological (BMI), other (data acquisition site, age-sex interactions) 	no		"A bit unclear whether some confounding factors were taken into account before or after network estimation, but it seems to be after (based on placement in the text).

Recent studies also suggest that neural risk markers associated with parental psychopathology may be transmitted across generations before symptoms emerge in offspring. There is limited understanding of how early similarity in brain functioning between 2 generations emerges. In the current study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) similarity between mothers and newborns during the first 3 months after the infant's birth. We found that FC similarity between mothers and infants increased as infant age increased. Furthermore, we examined whether maternal factors such as maternal socioeconomic status and prenatal maternal depressive symptoms may influence individual differences in FC similarity. For the whole-brain level, lower maternal education levels were associated with greater FC similarity. In previous literature, lower maternal education levels were associated with suboptimal cognitive and socioemotional development. Greater FC similarity may reflect that the infants develop their FC similarity prematurely, which may suboptimally influence their developmental outcomes in later ages.	30	NA	NA	- 30 mother-infant dyads	8	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, global signal regression) after: age (of mother and infant), sex (of infant), clinical/psychological (depressive symptoms), other (race, education).

We examined whether modularity of this network may underlie the vast individual differences found in human face recognition abilities. Modular networks, characterized by strong within and weaker between-network connectivity, were previously suggested to promote efficacy and reduce interference among cognitive systems and also correlated with better cognitive abilities. The study was conducted in a large sample (n = 409) with diffusion-weighted imaging, resting-state fMRI, and a behavioral face recognition measure. We defined a network of face-selective regions and derived a novel measure of communication along with structural and functional connectivity among them. The modularity of this network was positively correlated with recognition abilities even when controlled for age. Furthermore, the results were specific to the face network when compared with the place network or to spatially permuted null networks. The relation to behavior was also preserved at the individual-edge level such that a larger correlation to behavior was found within hemispheres and particularly within the right hemisphere. This study provides the first evidence of modularity-behavior relationships in the domain of face processing and more generally in visual perception.	453	NA	NA	NA	462	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes (absolutised)	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, global signal regression) after: age, gender.

Outlier detection in multimodal MRI identifies rare individual phenotypes among more than 15,000 brains	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Outliers in neuroimaging represent spurious data or the data of unusual phenotypes that deserve special attention such as clinical follow-up. Outliers have usually been detected in a supervised or semi-supervised manner for labeled neuroimaging cohorts. There has been much less work using unsupervised outlier detection on large unlabeled cohorts like the UK Biobank brain imaging dataset. Given its large sample size, rare imaging phenotypes within this unique cohort are of interest, as they are often clinically relevant and could be informative for discovering new processes. Here, we developed a two-level outlier detection and screening methodology to characterize individual outliers from the multimodal MRI dataset of more than 15,000 UK Biobank subjects. In primary screening, using brain ventricles, white matter, cortical thickness, and functional connectivity-based imaging phenotypes, every subject was parameterized with an outlier score per imaging phenotype. Outlier scores of these imaging phenotypes had good-to-excellent test-retest reliability, with the exception of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Due to the low reliability of RSFC outlier scores, RSFC outliers were excluded from further individual-level outlier screening. In secondary screening, the extreme outliers (1,026 subjects) were examined individually, and those arising from data collection/processing errors were eliminated. A representative subgroup of 120 subjects from the remaining non-artifactual outliers were radiologically reviewed, and radiological findings were identified in 97.5% of them. This study establishes an unsupervised framework for investigating rare individual imaging phenotypes within a large neuroimaging cohort.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- no network constructed, study on outliers and phenotypes

In contrast, recent studies examining listener-listener intersubject correlation (ISC) have proposed an active role of DMN in language comprehension. How can we reconcile those seemingly conflicting results? This study adopted a ""two-brain"" paradigm and combined ""within-brain"" and ""across-brain"" analyses to address this issue. We found, despite being deactivated and anticorrelated with the language network (LN) and executive control network (ECN), both the anterior and posterior DMN in the listeners' brains were temporally coupled with the homologous networks in the speaker's brain. Interestingly, the listener-speaker neural couplings persisted even after controlling for listener-listener ISC. Moreover, the coupling strength of posterior DMN positively correlated with the listeners' speech comprehension. Further dynamic causal modeling showed that the LN and ECN, the anterior DMN, and the posterior DMN occupied the bottom, intermediate, and top layers of a hierarchical system, respectively. We suggest the DMN may primarily serve as an internal module that cooperates with the externally oriented modules, potentially supporting the transformation of external acoustic signals into internal mental representations during successful language comprehension."	59	NA	59	NA	5	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (high-pass filtering, nuisance regression) after: clinical/psychological (task performance, speech/listening processing time)	no			#NAAM?

Theories of event segmentation and integration suggest that the hippocampus binds separately represented events into an ordered narrative. Using a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) movie watching-recall dataset, we quantified two types of neural similarities (i.e., ""activation pattern"" similarity and within-region voxel-based ""connectivity pattern"" similarity) between separate events during movie watching and related them to subsequent retrieval of events as well as retrieval of sequential order. We demonstrated that compared with forgotten events, successfully remembered events were associated with distinct ""activation patterns"" in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, similar ""connectivity pattern"" between events were associated with memory formation and were also relevant for retaining events in the correct order. We applied the same approaches to an independent movie watching fMRI dataset as validation and highlighted again the role of hippocampal activation pattern and connectivity pattern in memory formation. We propose that distinct activation patterns represent neural segmentation of events, while similar connectivity patterns encode context information and, therefore, integrate events into a narrative. Our results provide novel evidence for the role of hippocampal-medial prefrontal event segmentation and integration in episodic memory formation of real-life experience."	17	NA	NA	- the network with 1000 nodes was built from data from 1489 participants that were not part of the exprimental design - testing data set n = 64	503	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (high-pass filtering, timeseries shifted 3TRs to account hemodynamic response function) after: biological/physiological (hippocampal activation and connectivity pattern similarity), clinical/psychological (valence, arousal), other (perceptual features, event duration, location, music)	no		much in supplements, not quite clear what perceptual features are. 	- seems weighted (figure 2) but no explicit mention - network size: use both 6 ROIs and 1000 parcels; averaged for network size

Empirical work has shown that an accurate estimation of uncertainty is necessary for our optimal perception, learning, and decision-making. However, the role of this uncertainty in governing our affective dynamics remains unexplored. Using Bayesian encoding, decoding and computational modeling, on a large-scale neuroimaging and behavioral data on a passive movie-watching task, we showed that emotions naturally arise due to ongoing uncertainty estimations about future outcomes in a hierarchical neural architecture. Several prefrontal subregions hierarchically encoded a lower-dimensional signal that highly correlated with the evolving uncertainty. Crucially, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) tracked the temporal fluctuations of this uncertainty and was predictive of the participants' predisposition to anxiety. Furthermore, we observed a distinct functional double-dissociation within OFC with increased connectivity between medial OFC and DMN, while with that of lOFC and FPN in response to the evolving affect. Finally, we uncovered a temporally predictive code updating an individual's beliefs spontaneously with fluctuating outcome uncertainty in the lOFC. A biologically relevant and computationally crucial parameter in the theories of brain function, we propose uncertainty to be central to the definition of complex emotions.	111	NA	NA	- 60 behavioral participants	264	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (band pass filtering) during: other (subject variability, content variability, ROI-level variability, and subject sensitivity to uncertainty/valence/arousal).

Extracting electrophysiological correlates of functional magnetic resonance imaging data using the canonical polyadic decomposition	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	The relation between electrophysiology and BOLD-fMRI requires further elucidation. One approach for studying this relation is to find time-frequency features from electrophysiology that explain the variance of BOLD time-series. Convolution of these features with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) is often required to model neurovascular coupling mechanisms and thus account for time shifts between electrophysiological and BOLD-fMRI data. We propose a framework for extracting the spatial distribution of these time-frequency features while also estimating more flexible, region-specific HRFs. The core component of this method is the decomposition of a tensor containing impulse response functions using the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition. The outputs of this decomposition provide insight into the relation between electrophysiology and BOLD-fMRI and can be used to construct estimates of BOLD time-series. We demonstrated the performance of this method on simulated data while also examining the effects of simulated measurement noise and physiological confounds. Afterwards, we validated our method on publicly available task-based and resting-state EEG-fMRI data. We adjusted our method to accommodate the multisubject nature of these datasets, enabling the investigation of inter-subject variability with regards to EEG-to-BOLD neurovascular coupling mechanisms. We thus also demonstrate how EEG features for modelling the BOLD signal differ across subjects.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- no network was constructed, study is about Canonical Polyadic Decomposition

However, the behavioral impact of such reorganization is not well understood. The current neuroimaging study investigated age differences in the functional network architecture during semantic word retrieval in young and older adults. Combining task-based functional connectivity, graph theory and cognitive measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, our findings show age-accompanied large-scale network reorganization even when older adults have intact word retrieval abilities. In particular, functional networks of older adults were characterized by reduced decoupling between systems, reduced segregation and efficiency, and a larger number of hub regions relative to young adults. Exploring the predictive utility of these age-related changes in network topology revealed high, albeit less efficient, performance for older adults whose brain graphs showed stronger dedifferentiation and reduced distinctiveness. Our results extend theoretical accounts on neurocognitive aging by revealing the compensational potential of the commonly reported pattern of network dedifferentiation when older adults can rely on their prior knowledge for successful task processing. However, we also demonstrate the limitations of such compensatory reorganization and show that a youth-like network architecture in terms of balanced integration and segregation is associated with more economical processing.	58	NA	58	- 30 young + 28 elderly	64	NA	partial correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (confounding timeseries using fMRIprep, motion), physiological/biological (confounding timeseries using fMRIprep, global signal regression) after: scan related (motion), clinical/psychological (response time), other (education)	no			- network size: use both 7x7 and 121x121 matrices; averaged for network size - they mention first that connectivity matrices were unthresholded but then say they use orthogonalized minimum spanning trees on the weighted connectivity matrices for edge filtering (p. 5)

Narrow doorways alter brain connectivity and step patterns in isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Background: Motor impairments in those with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) significantly increases the likelihood of developing Lewy body disease (e.g. Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies). Objective: This study sought to explore the prodromal process of neurodegeneration by examining the neural signature underlying motor deficits in iRBD patients.Methods: A virtual reality (VR) gait paradigm (which has previously been shown to elicit adaptive changes in gait performance whilst navigating doorways in Parkinson's Disease PD) was paired with fMRI to investigate whether iRBD patients demonstrated worsened motor performance and altered connectivity across frontoparietal, motor and basal ganglia networks compared to healthy controls. Forty participants (23 iRBD and 17 healthy controls) completed the virtual reality gait task whilst in the MRI scanner, and an additional cohort of 19 Early PD patients completed the behavioural virtual reality gait task. Results: As predicted, iRBD patients demonstrated slower and more variable stepping compared to healthy control participants and demonstrated an exaggerated response when navigating narrow compared to wide doorways, a phenomenon characteristically seen in PD. The iRBD patients also demonstrated less BOLD signal change in the left posterior putamen and right mesencephalic locomotor region, as well as reduced functional connectivity between the frontoparietal network and the motor network, when navigating narrow versus wide doorways compared to healthy control participants.Conclusions: Taken together, this study demonstrates that iRBD patients have altered task-related brain connectivity, which may represent the neural underpinnings of early motor impairments that are evident in iRBD.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- seed based  - used the Marsbar toolbox, no very much information beyond that  - ""Functional connectivity analyses were performed by fitting the BOLD signal from the narrow versus wide doorway contrast to the generallinear model and then using the multiplication of temporal derivatives metric (Shine et al., 2015) to compute the average correlation between regions over time."" unclear what that means "		seed-based	task based - exclude		
Martin, S and Saur, D and Hartwigsen, G and Martin, Sandra and Saur, Dorothee and Hartwigsen, Gesa	Age-Dependent Contribution of Domain-General Networks to Semantic Cognition	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Aging is characterized by a decline of cognitive control. In semantic cognition, this leads to the paradox that older adults usually show poorer task performance than young adults despite their greater semantic knowledge. So far, the underlying neural changes of these behavioral differences are poorly understood. In the current neuroimaging study, we investigated the interaction of domain-specific and domain-general networks during verbal semantic fluency in young and older adults. Across age groups, task processing was characterized by a strong positive integration within the multiple-demand as well as between the multiple-demand and the default mode network during semantic fluency. However, the behavioral relevance of strengthened connectivity differed between groups: While within-network functional connectivity in both networks predicted greater efficiency in semantic fluency in young adults, it was associated with slower performance in older adults. Moreover, only young adults profited from connectivity between networks for their semantic memory performance. Our results suggest that the functional coupling of usually anticorrelated networks is critical for successful task processing, independent of age, when access to semantic memory is required. Furthermore, our findings lend novel support to the notion of reduced efficiency in the aging brain due to neural dedifferentiation in semantic cognition.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Functional reconfiguration of task-active frontoparietal control network facilitates abstract reasoning	CEREBRAL CORTEX	"While the brain's functional network architecture is largely conserved between resting and task states, small but significant changes in functional connectivity support complex cognition. In this study, we used a modified Raven's Progressive Matrices Task to examine symbolic and perceptual reasoning in human participants undergoing fMRI scanning. Previously, studies have focused predominantly on discrete symbolic versions of matrix reasoning, even though the first few trials of the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices task consist of continuous perceptual stimuli. Our analysis examined the activation patterns and functional reconfiguration of brain networks associated with resting state and both symbolic and perceptual reasoning. We found that frontoparietal networks, including the cognitive control and dorsal attention networks, were significantly activated during abstract reasoning. We determined that these same task-active regions exhibited flexibly-reconfigured functional connectivity when transitioning from resting state to the abstract reasoning task. Conversely, we showed that a stable network core of regions in default and somatomotor networks was maintained across both resting and task states. We propose that these regionally-specific changes in the functional connectivity of frontoparietal networks puts the brain in a ""task-ready"" state, facilitating efficient task-based activation."	27	NA	27	NA	400	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (band-pass filtering, denoising with CONN toolbox) after: clinical/psychological (response time) 	no

In previous neuroimaging studies of large-scale networks, neural variations in the resting state after sleep deprivation have been well documented, highlighting that large-scale networks implement efficient cognitive functions and attention regulation in a spatially hierarchical organization. However, alterations of neural networks during cognitive tasks have rarely been investigated. Methods and purposes The present study used a within-participant design of 35 healthy right-handed adults and used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural mechanism of attentional decline after sleep deprivation from the perspective of rich-club architecture during a psychomotor vigilance task. Results We found that a significant decline in the hub disruption index was related to impaired vigilance due to sleep loss. The hierarchical rich-club architectures were reconstructed after sleep deprivation, especially in the default mode network and sensorimotor network. Notably, the relatively fast alert response compensation was correlated with the feeder organizational hierarchy that connects core (rich-club) and peripheral nodes. Significances Our findings provide novel insights into understanding the relationship of alterations in vigilance and the hierarchical architectures of the human brain after sleep deprivation, emphasizing the significance of optimal collaboration between different functional hierarchies for regular attention maintenance.	35	NA	35	NA	160	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, global signal regression) after: scan related (motion)	no

Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Subjective Visibility from Those of Decision Confidence	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	A key goal of consciousness science is identifying neural signatures of being aware versus unaware of simple stimuli. This is often investigated in the context of near-threshold detection, with reports of stimulus awareness being linked to heightened activation in a frontoparietal network. However, because of reports of stimulus presence typically being associated with higher confidence than reports of stimulus absence, these results could be explained by frontoparietal regions encoding stimulus visibility, decision confidence, or both. In an exploratory analysis, we leverage fMRI data from 35 human participants (20 females) to disentangle these possibilities. We first show that, whereas stimulus identity was best decoded from the visual cortex, stimulus visibility (presence vs absence) was best decoded from prefrontal regions. To control for effects of confidence, we then selectively sampled trials before decoding to equalize confidence distributions between absence and presence responses. This analysis revealed striking differences in the neural correlates of subjective visibility in PFC ROIs, depending on whether or not differences in confidence were controlled for. We interpret our findings as highlighting the importance of controlling for metacognitive aspects of the decision process in the search for neural correlates of visual awareness.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- no network seems to have been constructed, activity not connectivity was analysed

Tonic pain alters functional connectivity of the descending pain modulatory network involving amygdala, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex	NEUROIMAGE	Introduction: Resting state functional connectivity (FC) is widely used to assess functional brain alterations in patients with chronic pain. However, reports of FC accompanying tonic pain in pain-free persons are rare. A network we term the Descending Pain Modulatory Network (DPMN) is implicated in healthy and pathologic pain modulation. Here, we evaluate the effect of tonic pain on FC of specific nodes of this network: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala (AMYG), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and parabrachial nuclei (PBN). Methods: In 50 pain-free participants (30F), we induced tonic pain using a capsaicin-heat pain model. functional MRI measured resting BOLD signal during pain-free rest with a 32 degrees C thermode and then tonic pain where participants experienced a previously warm temperature combined with capsaicin. We evaluated FC from ACC, AMYG, PAG, and PBN with correlation of self-report pain intensity during both states. We hypothesized tonic pain would diminish FC dyads within the DPMN. Results: Of all hypothesized FC dyads, only PAG and subgenual ACC was weakly altered during pain (F = 3.34; p = 0.074; pain-free>pain d = 0.25). After pain induction sACC-PAG FC became positively correlated with pain intensity (R = 0.38; t = 2.81; p = 0.007). Right PBN-PAG FC during pain-free rest positively correlated with subsequently experienced pain (R = 0.44; t = 3.43; p = 0.001). During pain, this connection's FC was diminished (paired t=-3.17; p = 0.0026). In whole-brain analyses, during pain-free rest, FC between left AMYG and right superior parietal lobule and caudate nucleus were positively correlated with subsequent pain. During pain, FC between left AMYG and right inferior temporal gyrus negatively correlated with pain. Subsequent pain positively correlated with right AMYG FC with right claustrum; right primary visual cortex and right temporo-occipitoparietal junction Conclusion: We demonstrate sACC-PAG tonic pain FC positively correlates with experienced pain and resting right PBN-PAG FC correlates with subsequent pain and is diminished during tonic pain. Finally, we reveal PAG-and right AMYG-anchored networks which correlate with subsequently experienced pain intensity.

Nathan	Age differences in the functional architecture of the human brain	CEREBRAL CORTEX	The intrinsic functional organization of the brain changes into older adulthood. Age differences are observed at multiple spatial scales, from global reductions in modularity and segregation of distributed brain systems, to network-specific patterns of dedifferentiation. Whether dedifferentiation reflects an inevitable, global shift in brain function with age, circumscribed, experience-dependent changes, or both, is uncertain. We employed a multimethod strategy to interrogate dedifferentiation at multiple spatial scales. Multi-echo (ME) resting-state fMRI was collected in younger (n = 181) and older (n = 120) healthy adults. Cortical parcellation sensitive to individual variation was implemented for precision functional mapping of each participant while preserving group-level parcel and network labels. ME-fMRI processing and gradient mapping identified global and macroscale network differences. Multivariate functional connectivity methods tested for microscale, edge-level differences. Older adults had lower BOLD signal dimensionality, consistent with global network dedifferentiation. Gradients were largely age-invariant. Edge-level analyses revealed discrete, network-specific dedifferentiation patterns in older adults. Visual and somatosensory regions were more integrated within the functional connectome; default and frontoparietal control network regions showed greater connectivity; and the dorsal attention network was more integrated with heteromodal regions. These findings highlight the importance of multiscale, multimethod approaches to characterize the architecture of functional brain aging.	301	NA	301	- 181 young + 120 elderly	192	NA	correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (denoising with TE-ICA) after: sex, physiological/biological (estimated whole-brain volume), other (education, site)	no			- network: use different parcellations with 400, 200, 17, 8, and 7 parcels but final matrix seems to be 192 - no mention of correlation type  - aggregated based on figure 1

Person-Based Similarity Index for Cognition and Its Neural Correlates in Late Adulthood: Implications for Cognitive Reserve	CEREBRAL CORTEX	"Healthy aging is typically associated with some level of cognitive decline, but there is substantial variation in such decline among older adults. The mechanisms behind such heterogeneity remain unclear but some have suggested a role for cognitive reserve. In this work, we propose the ""person-based similarity index"" for cognition (PBSI-Cog) as a proxy for cognitive reserve in older adults, and use the metric to quantify similarity between the cognitive profiles of healthy older and younger participants. In the current study, we computed this metric in 237 healthy older adults (55-88 years) using a reference group of 156 younger adults (18-39 years) taken from the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience dataset. Our key findings revealed that PBSI-Cog scores in older adults were: 1) negatively associated with age (rho=-0.25, P= 10(-4)) and positively associated with higher education (t= 2.4, P= 0.02), 2) largely explained by fluid intelligence and executive function, and 3) predicted more by functional connectivity between lower- and higher-order resting-state networks than brain structural morphometry or education. Particularly, we found that higher segregation between the sensorimotor and executive networks predicted higher PBSI-Cog scores. Our results support the notion that brain network functional organization may underly variability in cognitive reserve in late adulthood."	393	NA	393	237 elderly + 156 young	10	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering)  after: physiological/biological (variation in intracranial volume (ICV))	no			- network size: 5-network parcellation and 15 subnetwork parcellation used; averaged for network size - no mention of weights or selection

Previous findings suggested a causal involvement of the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) in belief updating in an attention task. We combined offline continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over rTPJ with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate local and remote stimulation effects within the attention and salience networks. In a sham-controlled, within-subject crossover design, 25 participants performed an attentional cueing task during fMRI with true or false information about cue predictability. By estimating learning rates from response times, we characterized participants' belief updating. Model-derived cue predictability entered the fMRI analysis as a parametric regressor to identify the neural correlates of updating. rTPJ-cTBS effects showed high interindividual variability. The expected learning rate reduction with false cue predictability information by cTBS was only observed in participants showing higher updating in false than in true blocks after sham. cTBS modulated the neural signatures of belief updating, both in rTPJ and in nodes of the attention and salience networks. The interindividual variability of the behavioral cTBS effect was related to differential activity and rTPJ connectivity of the right anterior insula. These results demonstrate a crucial interaction between ventral attention and salience networks for belief updating.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- ppi, no mention of selection, weight, or correlation type  		PPI

Most previous neuroimaging studies focused on identifying discrete brain regions responsible for the ANS and characterizing their functions in numerosity perception. However, a neuromarker to characterize an individual's ANS acuity is lacking, especially one based on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC). Here, based on the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data obtained from a large sample, we identified a distributed brain network (i.e. a numerosity network) using a connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) analysis. The summed FC strength within the numerosity network reliably predicted individual differences in ANS acuity regarding behavior, as measured using a nonsymbolic number-comparison task. Furthermore, in an independent dataset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we found that the summed FC strength within the numerosity network also specifically predicted individual differences in arithmetic skills, but not domain-general cognitive abilities. Therefore, our findings revealed that the identified numerosity network could serve as an applicable neuroimaging-based biomarker of nonverbal number acuity and arithmetic skills.	154	NA	154	- 154 for network construction - 145 for validation	201	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, global signal regression) after: age, gender, clinical/psyhological (domain-general cognitive skills)	no			#NAAM?

Prior studies in adults have unveiled a dominant functional hierarchy spanning from sensorimotor regions to transmodal regions, which is also present in younger cohorts. However, how the functional hierarchy develops and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be investigated. Here, we set out to investigate the developmental patterns of the functional hierarchy for preschool children (#scans = 141, age = 2.41-6.90 years) using a parsimonious general linear model and the underlying biological mechanisms by combining the neuroimaging developmental pattern with two separate transcriptomic datasets (i.e. Allen Human Brain Atlas and BrainSpan Atlas). Our results indicated that transmodal regions were further segregated from sensorimotor regions and that such changes were potentially driven by two gene clusters with distinct enrichment profiles, namely prenatal gene cluster and postnatal gene cluster. Additionally, we found similar developmental profiles manifested in subsequent developmental periods by conducting identical analyses on the Human Connectome Projects in Development (#scans = 638, age = 5.58-21.92 years) and Philadelphia Neurodevelopment Cohort datasets (#scans = 795, age = 8-21 years), driven by concordant two gene clusters. Together, these findings illuminate a comprehensive developmental principle of the functional hierarchy and the underpinning molecular factors, and thus may shed light on the potential pathobiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.	795	NA	NA	- 141 calgary preschool - 638 HCP - 795 PNC	998	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering)  after: sex, scan related (motion)	no			#NAAM?

Yet another facet of the problem may reside in the loss of the brain's ability to adapt to the damage incurred as the disease progresses. In this study, we attempted to examine whether changes associated with optic neuritis in the structural and functional visual networks can still be discerned in progressive patients even years after the acute insult. Forty-eight progressive multiple sclerosis patients, 21 with and 27 without prior optic neuritis, underwent structural and functional MRI, including DTI and resting state fMRI. Anatomical and functional visual networks were analyzed using graph theory-based methods. While no functional metrics were significantly different between the two groups, anatomical global efficiency and density were significantly lower in the optic neuritis group, despite no significant difference in lesion load between the groups. We conclude that long-standing distal damage to the optic nerve causes trans-synaptic effects and the early ability of the cortex to adapt may be altered, or possibly nullified. We suggest that this limited ability of the brain to compensate should be considered when attempting to explain the accumulation of disability in progressive multiple sclerosis patients.	48	48	NA	NA	50	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filtering) after: age, sex, scan related (scanner type), clinical/psychological (disease type, disease severity)	no			#NAAM?

However, brain-functional mechanisms underlying such cognitive enhancing effects of stimulants are still poorly characterized. Here, we utilized behavioral and resting-state fMRI data from a double-blind randomized placebocontrolled study of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine in 48 healthy male adults. The results show that performance in different memory tasks is enhanced, and functional connectivity (FC) specifically between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and default mode network (DMN) is modulated by the stimulants in comparison to placebo. Decreased negative connectivity between right prefrontal and medial parietal but also between medial temporal lobe and visual brain regions predicted stimulant-induced latent memory enhancement. We discuss dopamine's role in attention and memory as well as its ability to modulate FC between large-scale neural networks (e.g., FPN and DMN) as a potential cognitive enhancement mechanism.	48	NA	48	NA	268	NA	correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression)  after: clinical/psychological (stimulant treatment group), other (scan/treatment order)	no			#NAAM?

However, whether such asymmetry influences inter-hemispheric information transfer and behavioral performance is not known. Here we used a region of interest (ROI) and network-based approach to determine steady-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) in the whole cerebral cortex during a leftward/rightward covert visuospatial attention task. We found that the global FC topology between either ROIs or networks was independent on the attended side. The side of attention significantly modulated FC strength between brain networks, with leftward attention primarily involving the connections of the right visual network with dorsal and ventral attention networks in both the left and right hemisphere. High hemispheric functional segregation significantly correlated with faster target detection response times (i.e., better performance). Our findings suggest that the dominance of the right hemisphere in visuospatial attention is associated with an hemispheric functional segregation that is beneficial for behavioral performance.	15	NA	NA	NA	400	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression), clinical/psychological (task response time) after: age, sex, clinical/psychological (ocular dominance as measure of disease severity), other (handedness)	no

The neural bases of action-outcome learning in humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	From an associative perspective the acquisition of new goal-directed actions requires the encoding of specific action-outcome (AO) associations and, therefore, sensitivity to the validity of an action as a predictor of a specific outcome relative to other events. Although competitive architectures have been proposed within associative learning theory to achieve this kind of identity-based selection, whether and how these architectures are implemented by the brain is still a matter of conjecture. To investigate this issue, we trained human participants to encode various AO associations while undergoing functional neuroimaging (fMRI). We then degraded one AO contingency by increasing the probability of the outcome in the absence of its associated action while keeping other AO contingencies intact. We found that this treatment selectively reduced performance of the degraded action. Furthermore, when a signal predicted the unpaired outcome, performance of the action was restored, suggesting that the degradation effect reflects competition between the action and the context for prediction of the specific outcome. We used a Kalman filter to model the contribution of different causal variables to AO learning and found that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) tracked changes in the association of the action and context, respectively, with regard to the specific outcome. Furthermore, we found the mPFC participated in a network with the striatum and posterior parietal cortex to segregate the influence of the various competing predictors to establish specific AO associations.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

However, heterogeneous patterns reported across sites severely hindered its clinical generalization. Based on qualified nodal-based FC of 340 schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 348 normal controls (NC) acquired from seven different scanners, this study compared four commonly used site-effect correction methods in removing the site-related heterogeneities, and then tried to cluster the abnormal FCs into several replicable and independent disrupted subnets across sites, related them to clinical symptoms, and evaluated their potentials in schizophrenia classification. Among the four site-related heterogeneity correction methods, ComBat harmonization (F1 score: 0.806 +/- 0.145) achieved the overall best balance between sensitivity and false discovery rate in unraveling the aberrant FCs of schizophrenia in the local and public data sets. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified three replicable FC disruption subnets across the local and public data sets: hypo-connectivity within sensory areas (Net1), hypo-connectivity within thalamus, striatum, and ventral attention network (Net2), and hyper-connectivity between thalamus and sensory processing system (Net3). Notably, the derived composite FC within Net1 was negatively correlated with hostility and disorientation in the public validation set (p < .05). Finally, the three subnet-specific composite FCs (Best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.728) can robustly and meaningfully discriminate the SZ from NC with comparable performance with the full identified FCs features (best AUC = 0.765) in the out-of-sample public data set (Z = -1.583, p = .114). In conclusion, ComBat harmonization was most robust in detecting aberrant connectivity for schizophrenia. Besides, the three subnet-specific composite FC measures might be replicable neuroimaging markers for schizophrenia.	688	340	348	NA	246	NA	full correlation	aggregated	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering)  after: age, sex 	no

However, the underlying mechanisms related to brain function and connectivity are unknown. Objective: To identify brain connectivity alterations related to functional weakness we assessed network centrality changes in a group of patients with heterogeneous motor manifestations using task-free functional MRI in combination with different network centrality approaches. Methods: Task-free functional MRI was performed in 48 patients with heterogeneous motor manifestations including 28 patients showing functional weakness and 65 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Functional connectivity differences were assessed using different network centrality approaches, i.e. global correlation, eigenvector centrality, and intrinsic connectivity. Motor symptom severity was assessed using The Simplified Functional Movement Disorders Rating Scale and correlated with network centrality. Results: Comparing patients with and without functional weakness showed significant network centrality differences in the left temporoparietal junction and precuneus. Patients with functional weakness showed increased centrality in the same anatomical regions when comparing functional weakness with healthy controls. Moreover, in the same regions, patients with functional weakness showed a positive correlation between motor symptom severity and network centrality. This correlation was shown to be specific to functional weakness with an interaction analysis, confirming a significant difference between patients with and without functional weakness. Conclusions: We identified the temporoparietal junction and precuneus as key regions involved in brain connectivity alterations related to functional weakness. We propose that both regions may be promising targets for phenotype-specific non-invasive brain stimulation.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- seed based  - used CONN toolbox, not much information beyond that   - ""In order to further investigate network centrality alterations in terms of functional connectivity between brain regions, seed-based connectivity analysis was performed with the CONN toolbox using seed regions obtained with the GCOR measure and the FW > noFW+ contrast with a threshold of P < 0.0001.

A new multimodality fusion classification approach to explore the uniqueness of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) sharing overlapping symptoms have a long history of diagnostic confusion. It is unclear what their differences at a brain level are. Here, we propose a multimodality fusion classification approach to investigate their divergence in brain function and structure. Using brain functional network connectivity (FNC) calculated from resting-state fMRI data and gray matter volume (GMV) estimated from sMRI data, we classify the two disorders using the main data (335 SZ and 380 ASD patients) via an unbiased 10-fold cross-validation pipeline, and also validate the classification generalization ability on an independent cohort (120 SZ and 349 ASD patients). The classification accuracy reached up to 83.08% for the testing data and 72.10% for the independent data, significantly better than the results from using the single-modality features. The discriminative FNCs that were automatically selected primarily involved the sub-cortical, default mode, and visual domains. Interestingly, all discriminative FNCs relating to the default mode network showed an intermediate strength in healthy controls (HCs) between SZ and ASD patients. Their GMV differences were mainly driven by the frontal gyrus, temporal gyrus, and insula. Regarding these regions, the mean GMV of HC fell intermediate between that of SZ and ASD, and ASD showed the highest GMV. The middle frontal gyrus was associated with both functional and structural differences. In summary, our work reveals the unique neuroimaging characteristics of SZ and ASD that can achieve high and generalizable classification accuracy, supporting their potential as disorder-specific neural substrates of the two entwined disorders.	715	- 380 AD + 335 SZ (training data)	NA	- 349+120 independent data - 851 HCP data	53	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion) after: age, gender, other (site)	no			We calculated FNC of each subject by computing the Pearson correlation among the postprocessed time courses of 53 networks. but then did group level IC - individual or aggregated?

Reduced Hippocampal-Striatal Interactions during Formation of Durable Episodic Memories in Aging	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Encoding of durable episodic memories requires cross-talk between the hippocampus and multiple brain regions. Changes in these hippocampal interactions could contribute to age-related declines in the ability to form memories that can be retrieved after extended time intervals. Here we tested whether hippocampal-neocortical- and subcortical functional connectivity (FC) observed during encoding of durable episodic memories differed between younger and older adults. About 48 younger (20-38 years; 25 females) and 43 older (60-80 years; 25 females) adults were scanned with fMRI while performing an associative memory encoding task. Source memory was tested similar to 20 min and similar to 6 days postencoding. Associations recalled after 20 min but later forgotten were classified as transient, whereas memories retained after long delays were classified as durable. Results demonstrated that older adults showed a reduced ability to form durable memories and reduced hippocampal-caudate FC during encoding of durable memories. There was also a positive relationship between hippocampal-caudate FC and higher memory performance among the older adults. No reliable age group differences in durable memory-encoding activity or hippocampal-neocortical connectivity were observed. These results support the classic theory of striatal alterations as one cause of cognitive decline in aging and highlight that age-related changes in episodic memory extend beyond hippocampal-neocortical connections.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Twenty-seven previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects (10 males, mean age +/- SD 40.0 +/- 7.6 years) with clinically confirmed COVID-19 related hyposmia, and eighteen healthy, never SARS-CoV-2 infected, normosmic subjects (6 males, mean age +/- SD 36.0 +/- 7.1 years), were recruited in a 3 Tesla MRI study including high angular resolution diffusion and resting-state functional MRI acquisitions. Specialized metrics of structural and functional connectivity were derived from a standard parcellation of olfactory brain areas and a previously validated graph-theoretic model of the human olfactory functional network. These metrics were compared between groups and correlated to a clinical index of olfactory impairment. On the scanning day, all subjects were virus-free and cognitively unimpaired. Compared to control, both structural and functional connectivity metrics were found significantly increased in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. Greater residual olfactory impairment was associated with more segregated processing within regions more functionally connected to the anterior piriform cortex. An increased neural connectivity within the olfactory cortex was associated with a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection when the olfactory loss was a residual COVID-19 symptom. The functional connectivity of the anterior piriform cortex, the largest cortical recipient of afferent fibers from the olfactory bulb, accounted for the inter-individual variability in the sensory impairment. Albeit preliminary, these findings could feature a characteristic brain connectivity response in the presence of COVID-19 related residual hyposmia.	45	27	18	NA	22	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filtering, cardiac/respiration nuisance regression)  after: age, sex, scan related (motion)	no			"deconfounding (motion) in intermediate step after network estimation and before statistical analysis: ""The mean FD was regressed out from the series of r values (across subjects)."""

Early-onset schizophrenia provides an opportunity to explore the neuropathology of SZ early in the disorder and without the confound of antipsychotic mediation. However, it remains unexplored what deficits are shared or differ between adolescent early-onset (EOS) and adult-onset schizophrenia (AOS) patients. Here, based on 529 participants recruited from three independent cohorts, we explored AOS and EOS common and unique co-varying patterns by jointly analyzing three MRI features: fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), gray matter (GM), and functional network connectivity (FNC). Furthermore, a prediction model was built to evaluate whether the common deficits in drug-naive SZ could be replicated in chronic patients. Results demonstrated that (1) both EOS and AOS patients showed decreased fALFF and GM in default mode network, increased fALFF and GM in the sub-cortical network, and aberrant FNC primarily related to middle temporal gyrus; (2) the commonly identified regions in drug-naive SZ correlate with PANSS positive significantly, which can also predict PANSS positive in chronic SZ with longer duration of illness. Collectively, results suggest that multimodal imaging signatures shared by two types of drug-naive SZ are also associated with positive symptom severity in chronic SZ and may be vital for understanding the progressive schizophrenic brain structural and functional deficits.	529	280	249	- total of 529 - EOS cohort: 122 HC + 89 patient - AOS chohort: 34 HC + 34 patient - chronic SZ: 124 HC + 126 patient	49	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion) after: age, sex, scan related (motion, scanner type), other (site)	no			#NAAM?

However, NVC evidence derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging ignores the relationship of neuronal activity with vascular injury. Twenty-seven T2DM patients without MCI and thirty healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Brain regions with changed susceptibility detected by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) were used as seeds for functional connectivity (FC) analysis. NVC coefficients were estimated using combined degree centrality (DC) with susceptibility or cerebral blood flow (CBF). Partial correlations between neuroimaging indicators and cognitive decline were investigated. In T2DM group, higher susceptibility values in right hippocampal gyrus (R.PHG) were found and were negatively correlated with Naming Ability of Montreal Cognitive Assessment. FC increased remarkably between R.PHG and right middle temporal gyrus (R.MTG), right calcarine gyrus (R.CAL). Both NVC coefficients (DC-QSM and DC-CBF) reduced in R.PHG and increased in R.MTG and R.CAL. Both NVC coefficients in R.PHG and R.MTG increased with the improvement of cognitive ability, especially for executive function. These demonstrated that QSM and DC-QSM coefficients can be promising biomarkers for early evaluation of cognitive decline in T2DM patients and help to better understand the mechanism of NVC.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)				seed-based

The role of the arousal system in age-related differences in cortical functional network architecture	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	A common finding in the aging literature is that of the brain's decreased within- and increased between-network functional connectivity. However, it remains unclear what is causing this shift in network organization with age. Given the essential role of the ascending arousal system (ARAS) in cortical activation and previous findings of disrupted ARAS functioning with age, it is possible that age differences in ARAS functioning contribute to disrupted cortical connectivity. We test this possibility here using resting state fMRI data from over 500 individuals across the lifespan from the Cambridge Center for Aging and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) population-based cohort. Our results show that ARAS-cortical connectivity declines with age and, consistent with our expectations, significantly mediates some age-related differences in connectivity within and between association networks (specifically, within the default mode and between the default mode and salience networks). Additionally, connectivity between the ARAS and association networks predicted cognitive performance across several tasks over and above the effects of age and connectivity within the cortical networks themselves. These findings suggest that age differences in cortical connectivity may be driven, at least in part, by altered arousal signals from the brainstem and that ARAS-cortical connectivity relates to cognitive performance with age.	535	NA	NA	NA	32	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (high pass filtering), clinical/psychological (vascular health) after: scan related (motion), clinical/psychological (vascular health), other (education, mean connectivity (across regions and within each network))	no			- no explicit mention of 32 nodes but they mention the amount of nodes per network (sum = 32)  - no selection mentioned

The cerebellum is topographically organized into cerebello-cerebral circuits that create distinct functional networks regulating movement, cognition, and affect. SCA3-associated motor and nonmotor symptoms are possibly related not only to intracerebellar changes but also to disruption of the connectivity within these cerebello-cerebral circuits. However, to date, no comprehensive investigation of cerebello-cerebral connectivity in SCA3 has been conducted. The present study aimed to identify cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity alterations and associations with downstream clinical phenotypes and upstream topographic markers of cerebellar neurodegeneration in patients with SCA3. This study included 45 patients with SCA3 and 49 healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to characterize the cerebellar atrophy and to examine the cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity patterns. Structural MRI confirmed widespread gray matter atrophy in the motor and cognitive cerebellum of patients with SCA3. We found reduced functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortical networks, including the somatomotor, frontoparietal, and default networks; however, increased connectivity was observed between the cerebellum and the dorsal attention network. These abnormal patterns correlated with the CAG repeat expansion and deficits in global cognition. Our results indicate the contribution of cerebello-cerebral networks to the motor and cognitive impairments in patients with SCA3 and reveal that such alterations occur in association with cerebellar atrophy. These findings add important insights into our understanding of the role of the cerebellum in SCA3.	94	45	49	NA	5	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression) after: age, sex, scan related (motion), other(education)	no						no connectivity matrix, they calculate the intensity of frequency bands instead fo correlations - would exclude

Functional connectivity (FC) can reflect cerebral functional plasticity, and if social media can influence cerebral FC, then the FC of light social media users should be more similar to that of heavy users after they ""heavily"" used social media for a long period. We combined longitudinal study design and intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis to investigate this similarity. Thirty-five heavy and 21 light social media users underwent cognitive tests and functional MRIs. The 21 light social media users underwent another functional MRI scan after completing an additional four-week social media task. We conducted the ISC at the group, individual, and brain-region levels to investigate the similarity of FC and locate the brain regions most affected by social media. The FC of light social media users was more similar to that of heavy social media users after they completed the four-week social media task. Then, social media had an impact on half of the brain, involving almost all brain networks. Finally, cerebral FC that mostly affected by social media was associated with selective attention. We concluded that the impact of social media use on cerebral functional connectivity changes is revealed by ISC method and longitudinal design, which may provide guidance for clinical practice. The methods used in the current research could also be applied to similar domains."	70	NA	NA	- 30 (HSM) + 21 (LSM baseline) + 19 (LSM4wk)	116	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (high-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression)  after: age, physiological/biological (BMI), other (chatting, TV watching, playing games, other activities on phone (instead of social media, which was variable of interest))	no			#NAAM?

As the neurotransmitter systems targeted by methylphenidate undergo significant alterations throughout development, the effects of methylphenidate on functional connectivity may also be modulated by age. Therefore, we assessed the effects of a single methylphenidate challenge on brain network connectivity in stimulant-treatment naive children and adults with ADHD. We obtained resting-state functional MRI from 50 boys (10-12 years of age) and 49 men (23-40 years of age) with ADHD (DSM IV, all subtypes), before and after an oral challenge with 0.5 mg/kg methylphenidate; and from 11 boys and 12 men as typically developing controls. Connectivity strength (CS), eigenvector centrality (EC), and betweenness centrality (BC) were calculated for the striatum, thalamus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In line with our hypotheses, we found that methylphenidate decreased measures of connectivity and centrality in the striatum and thalamus in children with ADHD, but increased the same metrics in adults with ADHD. Surprisingly, we found no major effects of methylphenidate in the dACC and PFC in either children or adults. Interestingly, pre-methylphenidate, participants with ADHD showed aberrant connectivity and centrality compared to controls predominantly in frontal regions. Our findings demonstrate that methylphenidate's effects on connectivity of subcortical regions are age-dependent in stimulant-treatment naive participants with ADHD, likely due to ongoing maturation of dopamine and noradrenaline systems. These findings highlight the importance for future studies to take a developmental perspective when studying the effects of methylphenidate treatment.	102	81	21	NA	246	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (high and low-pass filtering to remove respiration artifacts) after: scan related (motion), other (whole brain connectivity strength, scanner type)	no			#NAAM?

State-like changes in the salience network correlate with delusion severity in first-episode psychosis patients	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Background and hypothesis: Delusions are characteristic of psychotic disorders; however, the brain correlates of delusions remain poorly known. Imaging studies on delusions typically compare images across individuals. Related confounding of inter-individual differences beyond delusions may be avoided by comparing delusional and non-delusional states within individuals. Study design: We studied correlations of delusions using intra-subject correlation (intra-SC) and inter-subject correlation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal time series, obtained during a movie stim-ulus at baseline and follow-up. We included 27 control subjects and 24 first-episode psychosis patients, who were free of delusions at follow-up, to calculate intra-SC between fMRI signals obtained during the two time points. In addition, we studied changes in functional connectivity at baseline and during the one-year follow-up using regions where delusion severity correlated with intra-SC as seeds. Results: The intra-SC correlated negatively with the baseline delusion severity in the bilateral anterior insula. In addition, we observed a subthreshold cluster in the anterior cingulate. These three regions constitute the cortical salience network (SN). Functional connectivity between the bilateral insula and the precuneus was weaker in the patients at baseline than in patients at follow-up or in control subjects at any time point. Conclusions: The results suggest that intra-SC is a powerful tool to study brain correlates of symptoms and highlight the role of the SN and internetwork dysconnectivity between the SN and the default mode network in delusions.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- used RESTplus toolbox, beyond that not much info - ""To calculate the functional connectivity maps we used the RESTplus toolbox (Jia et al., 2019), using the ROIs obtained in the SnPM intra-SC analyses as seeds.

Default Mode Network quantitative diffusion and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Grey matter involvement is a well-known feature in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), yet precise anatomy-based quantification of reduced diffusivity is still not fully understood. Default Mode Network (DMN) areas have been recently demonstrated as selectively involved in sCJD, and functional connectivity has never been investigated in prion diseases. We analyzed the grey matter involvement using a quantitatively multi-parametric MRI approach. Specifically, grey matter mean diffusivity of 37 subjects with sCJD was compared with that of 30 age-matched healthy controls with a group-wise approach. Differences in mean diffusivity were also examined between the cortical (MM(V)1, MM(V)2C, and VV1) and subcortical (VV2 and MV2K) subgroups of sCJD for those with autopsy data available (n = 27, 73%). We also assessed resting-state functional connectivity of both ventral and dorsal components of DMN in a subset of subject with a rs-fMRI dataset available (n = 17). Decreased diffusivity was predominantly present in posterior cortical regions of the DMN, but also outside of the DMN in temporal areas and in a few limbic and frontal areas, in addition to extensive deep nuclei involvement. Both subcortical and cortical sCJD subgroups showed decreased diffusivity subcortically, whereas only the cortical type expressed significantly decreased diffusivity cortically, mainly in parietal, occipital, and medial-inferior temporal cortices bilaterally. Interestingly, we found abnormally increased connectivity in both dorsal and ventral components of the DMN in sCJD subjects compared with healthy controls. The significance and possible utility of functional imaging as a biomarker for tracking disease progression in prion disease needs to be explored further.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- no very clear paper, number of nodes not mentioned

Threat vigilance and intrinsic amygdala connectivity	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	"A well-documented amygdala-dorsomedial prefrontal circuit is theorized to promote attention to threat (""threat vigilance""). Prior research has implicated a relationship between individual differences in trait anxiety/vigilance, engagement of this circuitry, and anxiogenic features of the environment (e.g., through threat-of-shock and movie-watching). In the present study, we predicted that-for those scoring high in self-reported anxiety and a behavioral measure of threat vigilance-this circuitry is chronically engaged, even in the absence of anxiogenic stimuli. Our analyses of resting-state fMRI data (N = 639) did not, however, provide evidence for such a relationship. Nevertheless, in our planned exploratory analyses, we saw a relationship between threat vigilance behavior (but not self-reported anxiety) and intrinsic amygdala-periaqueductal gray connectivity. Here, we suggest this subcortical circuitry may be chronically engaged in hypervigilant individuals, but that amygdala-prefrontal circuitry may only be engaged in response to anxiogenic stimuli."	649	NA	NA	NA	10	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (global signal regression) after: age, sex, scan related (motion)	no			- network size based on fig 3 a  - unclear whether group level analysis is of correct kind

A comparison of the functional connectome in mild traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often co-occur in the context of threat to one's life. These conditions also have an overlapping symptomatology and include symptoms of anxiety, poor concentration and memory problems. A major challenge has been articulating the underlying neurobiology of these overlapping conditions. The primary aim of this study was to compare intrinsic functional connectivity between mTBI (without PTSD) and PTSD (without mTBI). The study included functional MRI data from 176 participants: 42 participants with mTBI, 67 with PTSD and a comparison group of 66 age and sex-matched healthy controls. We used network-based statistical analyses for connectome-wide comparisons of intrinsic functional connectivity between mTBI relative to PTSD and controls. Our results showed no connectivity differences between mTBI and PTSD groups. However, we did find that mTBI had significantly reduced connectivity relative to healthy controls within an extensive network of regions including default mode, executive control, visual and auditory networks. The mTBI group also displayed hyperconnectivity between dorsal and ventral attention networks and perceptual regions. The PTSD group also demonstrated abnormal connectivity within these networks relative to controls. Connectivity alterations were not associated with severity of PTSD or post-concussive symptoms in either clinical group. Taken together, the similar profiles of intrinsic connectivity alterations in these two conditions provide neural evidence that can explain, in part, the overlapping symptomatology between mTBI and PTSD.	176	109	66	- actually 175 but abstract says 176	343	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (negative edges set to 0)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering) after: clinical/psychological (duration since trauma)	no

As a brain network disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was characterized by substantial alteration in FC, but the contribution of moment-to-moment-activity cofluctuations to the overall dysfunctional connectivity pattern in ASD remains poorly understood. Here, we used the cofluctuation approach to explore the underlying dynamic properties of FC in ASD, using a large multisite resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) dataset (ASD = 354, typically developing controls [TD] = 446). Our results verified that the networks estimated using high-amplitude frames were highly correlated with the traditional rsFC. Moreover, these frames showed higher average amplitudes in participants with ASD than those in the TD group. Principal component analysis was performed on the activity patterns in these frames and aggregated over all subjects. The first principal component (PC1) corresponds to the default mode network (DMN), and the PC1 coefficients were greater in participants with ASD than those in the TD group. Additionally, increased ASD symptom severity was associated with the increased coefficients, which may result in excessive internally oriented cognition and social cognition deficits in individuals with ASD. Our finding highlights the utility of cofluctuation approaches in prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders and verifies that the aberrant contribution of DMN to rsFC may underline the symptomatology in adolescents and youths with ASD.	800	354	446	NA	200	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering)  after: gender, scan related (motion), other (site (using ComBat), IQ, handedness)	no			#NAAM?

For illustration of this hypothesis, resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) data were collected and analyzed on 38 ""definite"" or ""probable"" ALS patients (19 fast and 19 slow, cut off median = 0.41) and 37 matched healthy controls. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and functional connectivity strength (FCS) were analyzed within the PSMA. There was a decreased ALFF (p(FDR) <.05) and FCS (p = .022) in all ALS patients. The two metrics shared about 50% of variance (R = .7) and both showed significant positive correlation with ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) in the fast (p values <.034) but not in the slow progression groups. Interestingly, when regressing out the ALFF, the PSMA network FCS, especially the inter-hemisphere FCS, showed negative correlation with the ALSFRS-R score in the slow (R = -.54, p = .026) but not the fast progression group. In summary, the current results suggest that RS-fMRI local activity and network functional connectivity accounts for the severity differently in the slow and fast progression ALS patients."	75	38	37	NA	102	NA	coherence	individual	not applicable	not applicable	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression) after: other (fALFF connectivity measure from separate analysis)	no			#NAAM?

Access to visual speech information is particularly useful when the auditory signal is degraded. Here, we used fMRI to monitor brain activity while adult humans (n = 60) were presented with visual-only, auditory-only, and audiovisual words. The audiovisual words were presented in quiet and in several signal-to-noise ratios. As expected, audiovisual speech perception recruited both auditory and visual cortex, with some evidence for increased recruitment of premotor cortex in some conditions (including in substantial background noise). We then investigated neural connectivity using psychophysiological interaction analysis with seed regions in both primary auditory cortex and primary visual cortex. Connectivity between auditory and visual cortices was stronger in audiovisual conditions than in unimodal conditions, including a wide network of regions in posterior temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we also conducted a region-of-interest analysis on the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), implicated in many previous studies of audiovisual speech perception. We found evidence for both activity and effective connectivity in pSTS for visual-only and audiovisual speech, although these were not significant in whole-brain analyses. Together, our results suggest a prominent role for cross-region synchronization in understanding both visual-only and audiovisual speech that complements activity in integrative brain regions like pSTS.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?			task-based, reject

However, the nature of this impairment, the relative involvement of different striatal areas, their imbalance in genetically related but unimpaired individuals, and their relationship with cognitive dysfunction in OCD patients, remain unknown. Methods: In the current study, striatal (i.e., caudate and putamen) whole-brain connectivity was computed in a sample of OCD patients (OCD, n = 62), unaffected first-degree relatives (UFDR, n = 53) and healthy controls (HC, n = 73) by ROI-based resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). A behavioral task switch paradigm outside of the scanner was also performed to measure cognitive flexibility in OCD patients. Results: There were significantly increased strengths (Z-transformed Pearson correlation coefficient) in caudate connectivity in OCD patients. A significant correlation between the two types of connectivity strengths in the relevant regions was observed only in the OCD patient group. Furthermore, the caudate connectivity of patients was negatively associated with their task-switch performance. Conclusions: The imbalance between the caudate and putamen connectivity, arising from the abnormal increase of caudate activity, may serve as a clinical characteristic for obsessive-compulsive disorder.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- seed to voxel (only seeds named in table)   - edge selection seems to be: ""Finally, the functional connectivity values (Z) were averaged for supra-threshold caudate and putamen connectivity separately.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is related to a high risk of dementia. However, the mechanism underlying MCI in MSA remains controversial. In this study, we conducted the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analyses to detect the characteristics of local neural activity and corresponding network alterations in MSA patients with MCI (MSA-MCI). We enrolled 80 probable MSA patients classified as cognitively normal (MSA-NC, n = 36) and MSA-MCI (n = 44) and 40 healthy controls. Compared with MSA-NC, MSA-MCI exhibited decreased ALFF in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (RDLPFC) and increased ALFF in the right cerebellar lobule IX and lobule IV-V. In the secondary FC analyses, decreased FC in the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) was observed when we set the RDLPFC as the seed region. Decreased FC in the bilateral cuneus, left precuneus, and left IPL and increased FC in the right middle temporal gyrus were shown when we set the right cerebellar lobule IX as the seed region. Furthermore, FC of DLPFC-IPL and cerebello-cerebral circuit, as well as ALFF alterations, were significantly correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores in MSA patients. We also employed whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis, but no gray matter atrophy was detected between the patient subgroups. Our findings indicate that altered spontaneous activity in the DLPFC and the cerebellum and disrupted DLPFC-IPL, cerebello-cerebral networks are possible biomarkers of early cognitive decline in MSA patients.	120	80	40	NA	3	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), gender (sample matching), other (eduction (sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression) after: age, gender, clinical/psychological (disease duration, levodopa equivalent dose), other (education)	no			#NAAM?

This study examined the neurocognitive underpinnings of these neural activations and functional connectivity of the identified brain regions using a within-subject design. Thirty-one native Mandarin speakers performed orthographic, phonological, and semantic judgment tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results indicated that the three processes shared a core network consisting of a large region in the left prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and medial superior frontal gyrus but not the superior temporal gyrus. Orthographic processing more strongly recruited the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left superior parietal lobule and bilateral fusiform gyri; semantic processing more strongly recruited the left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus, whereas phonological processing more strongly activated the dorsal part of the precentral gyrus. Functional connectivity analysis identified a posterior visuospatial network and a frontal phonosemantic network interfaced by the left middle frontal gyrus. We conclude that reading Chinese recruits cognitive resources that correspond to basic task demands with unique features best explained in connection with the individual reading subprocesses.	31	NA	NA	NA	8	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (temporal filtering for denoising) after: sex (tested group differences)	no			"- task based but contains all relevant elements thus analysed as resting state?  - thresholding based on fig 4 ""Reported connections survived at a false discovery rate (FDR)corrected p value of .05."""	include: task-based but perform network analysis.

Musical memories in newborns: A resting-state functional connectivity study	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Music is known to induce emotions and activate associated memories, including musical memories. In adults, it is well known that music activates both working memory and limbic networks. We have recently discovered that as early as during the newborn period, familiar music is processed differently from unfamiliar music. The present study evaluates music listening effects at the brain level in newborns, by exploring the impact of familiar or first-time music listening on the subsequent resting-state functional connectivity in the brain. Using a connectome-based framework, we describe resting-state functional connectivity (RS-FC) modulation after music listening in three groups of newborn infants, in preterm infants exposed to music during their neonatal-intensive-care-unit (NICU) stay, in control preterm, and full-term infants. We observed modulation of the RS-FC between brain regions known to be implicated in music and emotions processing, immediately following music listening in all newborn infants. In the music exposed group, we found increased RS-FC between brain regions known to be implicated in familiar and emotionally arousing music and multisensory processing, and therefore implying memory retrieval and associative memory. We demonstrate a positive correlation between the occurrence of the prior music exposure and increased RS-FC in brain regions implicated in multisensory and emotional processing, indicating strong engagement of musical memories; and a negative correlation with the Default Mode Network, indicating disengagement due to the aforementioned cognitive processing. Our results describe the modulatory effect of music listening on brain RS-FC that can be linked to brain correlates of musical memory engrams in preterm infants.	46	NA	NA	- 15 PM + 15 PC + 16 fetuses (need to exclude?)	90	NA	accordance of activation peaks	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (nuisance covariate regression, band pass filtering) after: other (effect of listening to music for the first time)	no			- note: 16 fetuses among subjects	"regression was used to create a matrix with dimensions [number of volumes, 90 brain regions].

However, the trajectories of these functional networks across development are unclear and designing a metric to track the complex trajectory of these characteristics throughout the lifespan is challenging. Here, permutation entropy (PE) was used to examine age-related variations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects aged 6-85 from global, network, and nodal perspectives. The global PE followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory that peaked at approximately age 40. The trajectory of the motor and somatosensory functional network was more consistent with a linear model and increased with age; other functional networks showed inverted U-shaped trajectories that peaked between 25 and 52 years of age. All nodes showed inverted U-shaped trajectories. Using cluster analysis, the peak ages of nodes were grouped into three clusters (at 24, 38, and 51 years). Overall, we characterized four aging trajectories: networks with a linear increase, early peak age, intermediate peak age, and older peak age. These findings suggest possible complexity in trajectories at critical age points regarding changes in related functional brain networks.	319	NA	319	NA	264	NA	permutation entropy	individual	not applicable	not applicable	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, signal drift)  after: physiological/biological (GM and CSF volume)	no					no

Altered resting-state neural networks in children and adolescents with functional neurological disorder	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Objectives: Previous studies with adults suggest that aberrant communication between neural networks underpins functional neurological disorder (FND). The current study adopts a data-driven approach to investigate the extent that functional resting-state networks are disrupted in a pediatric mixed-FND cohort. Methods: 31 children with mixed FND and 33 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed resting-state fMRI scans. Whole-brain independent component analysis (pFWE < 0.05) was then used to identify group differences in resting-state connectivity. Self-report measures included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Early Life Stress Questionnaire (ELSQ). Resting-state heart rate (HR) and cortisol-awakening response (CAR) were available in a subset. Results: Children with FND showed wide-ranging connectivity changes in eight independent components corresponding to eight resting-state neural networks: language networks (IC6 and IC1), visual network, frontoparietal network, salience network, dorsal attention network, cerebellar network, and sensorimotor network. Children whose clinical presentation included functional seizures (vs children with other FND symptoms) showed greater connectivity decreases in the frontoparietal and dorsal attentional networks. Subjective distress (total DASS score), autonomic arousal (indexed by HR), and HPA dysregulation (attenuated/reversed CAR) contributed to changes in neural network connectivity. Children with FND (vs controls) reported more subjective distress (total DASS score) and more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) across their lifespan. Conclusions: Children with FND demonstrate changes in resting-state connectivity. Identified network alterations underpin a broad range of functions typically disrupted in children with FND. This study complements the adult literature by suggesting that FND in children and adolescents emerges in the context of their lived experience and that it reflects aberrant communication across neural networks.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- missing information beyond use of toolbox: ""Neuroimaging data were pre-processed using the CONN functional connectivity toolbox (Version 19c) and SPM 12"""		no	this just used a pearson's r (in addition to the time lag metric), so this can be included right?

Three-way parallel group independent component analysis: Fusion of spatial and spatiotemporal magnetic resonance imaging data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Advances in imaging acquisition techniques allow multiple imaging modalities to be collected from the same subject. Each individual modality offers limited yet unique views of the functional, structural, or dynamic temporal features of the brain. Multimodal fusion provides effective ways to leverage these complementary perspectives from multiple modalities. However, the majority of current multimodal fusion approaches involving functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are limited to 3D feature summaries that do not incorporate its rich temporal information. Thus, we propose a novel three-way parallel group independent component analysis (pGICA) fusion method that incorporates the first-level 4D fMRI data (temporal information included) by parallelizing group ICA into parallel ICA via a unified optimization framework. A new variability matrix was defined to capture subject-wise functional variability and then link it to the mixing matrices of the other two modalities. Simulation results show that the three-way pGICA provides highly accurate cross-modality linkage estimation under both weakly and strongly correlated conditions, as well as comparable source estimation under different noise levels. Results using real brain imaging data identified one linked functional-structural-diffusion component associated to differences between schizophrenia and controls. This was replicated in an independent cohort, and the identified components were also correlated with major cognitive domains. Functional network connectivity revealed visual-subcortical and default mode-cerebellum pairs that discriminate between schizophrenia and controls. Overall, both simulation and real data results support the use of three-way pGICA to identify multimodal spatiotemporal links and to pursue the study of brain disorders under a single unifying multimodal framework.	254	123	131	NA	19	NA	full correlation	multilevel	yes (regularisation)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), gender (sample matching), scan related (motion) after: age, gender, other (site)	no								
Rebollo, I and Tallon-Baudry, C and Rebollo, Ignacio and Tallon-Baudry, Catherine	The Sensory and Motor Components of the Cortical Hierarchy Are Coupled to the Rhythm of the Stomach during Rest	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	Bodily rhythms appear as novel scaffolding mechanisms orchestrating the spatiotemporal organization of spontaneous brain activity. Here, we follow-up on the discovery of the gastric resting-state network (Rebollo et al., 2018), composed of brain regions in which the fMRI signal is phase-synchronized to the slow (0.05 Hz) electrical rhythm of the stomach. Using a larger sample size (n = 63 human participants, both genders), we further characterize the anatomy and effect sizes of gastric-brain coupling across resting-state networks, a fine grained cortical parcellation, as well as along the main gradients of cortical or-ganization. Most (67%) of the gastric network is included in the somato-motor-auditory (38%) and visual (29%) resting state networks (RSNs). Gastric brain coupling also occurs in the granular insula and, to a lesser extent, in the piriform cortex. Thus, all sensory and motor cortices corresponding to both exteroceptive and interoceptive modalities are coupled to the gas-tric rhythm during rest. Conversely, little gastric-brain coupling occurs in cognitive networks and transmodal regions. These results suggest not only that gastric rhythm and sensory-motor processes are likely to interact, but also that gastric-brain coupling might be a mechanism of sensory and motor integration that mostly bypasses cognition, complementing the classi-cal hierarchical organization of the human brain.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- the ROIs are studied for analysing ROI overlap with the gastic network  - ""For each region of the parcellation, we determined the overlap with the gastric network (percentage of the area in the gastric network), as well as the average effect sizes across significant gastric network vertices.

"The ""vestibular neuromatrix"": A proposed, expanded vestibular network from graph theory in post-concussive vestibular dysfunction"	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	"Convergent clinical and neuroimaging evidence suggests that higher vestibular function is subserved by a distributed network including visuospatial, cognitive-affective, proprioceptive, and integrative brain regions. Clinical vestibular syndromes may perturb this network, resulting in deficits across a variety of functional domains. Here, we leverage structural and functional neuroimaging to characterize this extended network in healthy control participants and patients with post-concussive vestibular dysfunction (PCVD). Then, 27 healthy control subjects (15 females) and 18 patients with subacute PCVD (12 female) were selected for participation. Eighty-two regions of interest (network nodes) were identified based on previous publications, group-wise differences in BOLD signal amplitude and connectivity, and multivariate pattern analysis on affective tests. Group-specific ""core"" networks, as well as a ""consensus"" network comprised of connections common to all participants, were then generated based on probabilistic tractography and functional connectivity between the 82 nodes and subjected to analyses of node centrality and community structure. Whereas the consensus network was comprised of affective, integrative, and vestibular nodes, PCVD participants exhibited diminished integration and centrality among vestibular and affective nodes and increased centrality of visual, supplementary motor, and frontal and cingulate eye field nodes. Clinical outcomes, derived from dynamic posturography, were associated with approximately 62% of all connections but best predicted by amygdalar, prefrontal, and cingulate connectivity. No group-wise differences in diffusion metrics or tractography were noted. These findings indicate that cognitive, affective, and proprioceptive substrates contribute to vestibular processing and performance and highlight the need to consider these domains during clinical diagnosis and treatment planning."	45	18	27	NA	82	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (band pass filtering)  after: age, clinical/psychological (days since injury)	no			"- "" subjected them to OLS regression to obtain a bivariate ROI–ROI correlation coefficient."" regression to obtain correlation coefficient? - subsequent fusion of structural and functional FCs on group level - individual or aggregated?

Thome, J and Steinbach, R and Grosskreutz, J and Durstewitz, D and Koppe, G and Thome, Janine and Steinbach, Robert and Grosskreutz, Julian and Durstewitz, Daniel and Koppe, Georgia	Classification of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by brain volume, connectivity, and network dynamics	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Emerging studies corroborate the importance of neuroimaging biomarkers and machine learning to improve diagnostic classification of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While most studies focus on structural data, recent studies assessing functional connectivity between brain regions by linear methods highlight the role of brain function. These studies have yet to be combined with brain structure and nonlinear functional features. We investigate the role of linear and nonlinear functional brain features, and the benefit of combining brain structure and function for ALS classification. ALS patients (N = 97) and healthy controls (N = 59) underwent structural and functional resting state magnetic resonance imaging. Based on key hubs of resting state networks, we defined three feature sets comprising brain volume, resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), as well as (nonlinear) resting state dynamics assessed via recurrent neural networks. Unimodal and multimodal random forest classifiers were built to classify ALS. Out-of-sample prediction errors were assessed via five-fold cross-validation. Unimodal classifiers achieved a classification accuracy of 56.35-61.66%. Multimodal classifiers outperformed unimodal classifiers achieving accuracies of 62.85-66.82%. Evaluating the ranking of individual features' importance scores across all classifiers revealed that rsFC features were most dominant in classification. While univariate analyses revealed reduced rsFC in ALS patients, functional features more generally indicated deficits in information integration across resting state brain networks in ALS. The present work undermines that combining brain structure and function provides an additional benefit to diagnostic classification, as indicated by multimodal classifiers, while emphasizing the importance of capturing both linear and nonlinear functional brain properties to identify discriminative biomarkers of ALS.	156	97	59	NA	12	NA	regression	individual	yes (regularisation)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological/biological (band pass filtering) during: physiological/biological (regressors of no interest to remove cardiac and respiration artifacts) after: age	no

Here, we introduce a fully data-driven approach based on graph learning to extract meaningful repeating network patterns from regionally-averaged timecourses. We use the Graph Laplacian Mixture Model (GLMM), a generative model that treats functional data as a collection of signals expressed on multiple underlying graphs. By exploiting covariance between activity of brain regions, these graphs can be learned without resorting to structural information. To validate the proposed technique, we first apply it to task fMRI with a known experimental paradigm. The probability of each graph to occur at each time-point is found to be consistent with the task timing, while the spatial patterns associated to each epoch of the task are in line with previously established activation patterns using classical regression analysis. We further on apply the technique to resting state data, which leads to extracted graphs that correspond to well-known brain functional activation patterns. The GLMM allows to learn graphs entirely from the functional activity that, in practice, turn out to reveal high degrees of similarity to the structural connectome. The Default Mode Network (DMN) is always captured by the algorithm in the different tasks and resting state data. Therefore, we compare the states corresponding to this network within themselves and with structure. Overall, this method allows us to infer relevant functional brain networks without the need of structural connectome information. Moreover, we overcome the limitations of windowing the time sequences by feeding the GLMM with the whole functional signal and neglecting the focus on sub-portions of the signals.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?		no

Unraveling the functional attributes of the language connectome: crucial subnetworks, flexibility and variability	NEUROIMAGE	Language processing is a highly integrative function, intertwining linguistic operations (processing the language code intentionally used for communication) and extra-linguistic processes (e.g., attention monitoring, predictive inference, long-term memory). This synergetic cognitive architecture requires a distributed and specialized neural substrate. Brain systems have mainly been examined at rest. However, task-related functional connectivity pro-vides additional and valuable information about how information is processed when various cognitive states are involved. We gathered thirteen language fMRI tasks in a unique database of one hundred and fifty neurotypical adults (InLang [Interactive networks of Language] database ), providing the opportunity to assess language features across a wide range of linguistic processes. Using this database, we applied network theory as a computational tool to model the task-related functional connectome of language (LANG atlas). The organization of this data -driven neurocognitive atlas of language was examined at multiple levels, uncovering its major components (or crucial subnetworks ), and its anatomical and functional correlates. In addition, we estimated its reconfiguration as a function of linguistic demand ( flexibility ) or several factors such as age or gender ( variability ). We observed that several discrete networks could be specifically shaped to promote key functional features of language: coding -decoding (Net1), control-executive (Net2), abstract-knowledge (Net3), and sensorimotor (Net4) functions. The architecture of these systems and the functional connectivity of the pivotal brain regions varied according to the nature of the linguistic process, gender, or age. By accounting for the multifaceted nature of language and mod-ulating factors, this study can contribute to enriching and refining existing neurocognitive models of language. The LANG atlas can also be considered a reference for comparative or clinical studies involving various patients and conditions.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?		no

Brainstem stroke may disrupt network connectivity across the whole brain and affect multidomain cognition, but the details of this process remain unclear. The study aimed to investigate the effects of stroke-induced pontine injury on whole-brain network connectivity and cognitive function. We included 47 patients with pontine stroke and 56 healthy comparisons (HC), who underwent cognitive tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seven meaningful brain networks were identified using independent component analysis (ICA). Patients with pontine stroke had decreased intra-network functional connectivities (FCs) in the primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks, including sensorimotor network (SMN), visual network (VIS), default mode network (DMN), and salience network (SAN), as well as decreased inter-network FCs in the primary perceptual (VIS-SMN) and higher cognitive control networks (bilateral frontoparietal networks, rFPN-lFPN). While the FCs between the primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks (VIS-DMN, VIS-rFPN, VIS-lFPN) were increased. Furthermore, the alterations in these FCs correlated with patients' cognitive measurements. These findings suggested that the infratentorial stroke can induce dysfunctional connectivity in both primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks at the whole-brain level, which may be attributable to the neural substrates of multidomain cognitive deficits in these patients.	103	47	56	NA	7	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), other (eduction (sample matching)), scan related (motion) after: age, sex, scan related (motion), other (education)	no			#NAAM?

However, to ensure high-quality data, one should mitigate fMRI-related noise typical of this population. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the ability of different preprocessing strategies to mitigate noise-related signal (i.e., in-scanner movement and physiological noise) in functional connectivity (FC) of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. We applied nine commonly used denoising strategies, combined into 17 pipelines, to 88 TBI patients from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Anti-epileptogenic Therapy clinical trial. Pipelines were evaluated by three quality control (QC) metrics across three exclusion regimes based on the participant's head movement profile. While no pipeline eliminated noise effects on FC, some pipelines exhibited relatively high effectiveness depending on the exclusion regime. Once high-motion participants were excluded, the choice of denoising pipeline becomes secondary - although this strategy leads to substantial data loss. Pipelines combining spike regression with physiological regressors were the best performers, whereas pipelines that used automated data-driven methods performed comparatively worse. In this study, we report the first large-scale evaluation of denoising pipelines aimed at reducing noise-related FC in a clinical population known to be highly susceptible to in-scanner motion and significant anatomical abnormalities. If resting-state functional magnetic resonance is to be a successful clinical technique, it is crucial that procedures mitigating the effect of noise be systematically evaluated in the most challenging populations, such as TBI datasets.	88	88	NA	NA	333	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, removal of cardiac/respiration artifacts using nuisance covariate regression).

In this study, we constructed a predictive model from the resting-state functional data of 47 drug-naive patients by using a connectome-based approach. This model was subsequently validated in 115 drug-managed patients. The severity of motor impairment was assessed by calculating Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores. The predictive performance of model was evaluated using the correlation coefficient (r(true)) between predicted and observed scores. As a result, a connectome-based model for predicting individual motor impairment in drug-naive patients was identified with significant performance (r(true) = .845, p < .001, p(permu) = .002). Two patterns of connection were identified according to correlations between connection strength and the severity of motor impairment. The negative motor-impairment-related network contained more within-network connections in the motor, visual-related, and default mode networks, whereas the positive motor-impairment-related network was constructed mostly with between-network connections coupling the motor-visual, motor-limbic, and motor-basal ganglia networks. Finally, this predictive model constructed around drug-naive patients was confirmed with significant predictive efficacy on drug-managed patients (r = .209, p = .025), suggesting a generalizability in Parkinson's disease patients under long-term drug influence. In conclusion, this study identified a whole-brain connectome-based model that could predict the severity of motor impairment in Parkinson's patients and furthers our understanding of the functional underpinnings of the disease.	162	162	NA	- comprising 47 drug naive + 115 drug managed patients	268	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (cross validation)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band-pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression) after: other (network size variations between individuals)	no			#NAAM?

Connectivity between default mode and frontoparietal networks mediates the association between global amyloid-beta and episodic memory	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Beta eta-amyloid (A beta) is a neurotoxic protein that deposits early in the pathogenesis of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to identify network connectivity that may alter the negative effect of A beta on cognition. Following assessment of memory performance, resting-state fMRI, and mean cortical PET-A beta, a total of 364 older adults (286 with clinical dementia rating [CDR-0], 59 with CDR-0.5 and 19 with CDR-1, mean age: 74.0 +/- 6.4 years) from the OASIS-3 sample were included in the analysis. Across all participants, a partial least squares regression showed that lower connectivity between posterior medial default mode and frontoparietal networks, higher within-default mode, and higher visual-motor connectivity predict better episodic memory. These connectivities partially mediate the effect of A beta on episodic memory. These results suggest that connectivity strength between the precuneus cortex and the superior frontal gyri may alter the negative effect of A beta on episodic memory. In contrast, education was associated with different functional connectivity patterns. In conclusion, functional characteristics of specific brain networks may help identify amyloid-positive individuals with a higher likelihood of memory decline, with implications for AD clinical trials.	420	NA	420	NA	21	NA	partial correlation	aggregated	yes (regularisation)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion) after: age, sex, scan related (motion (root mean square realignment, calculated during data preprocessing))	no			#NAAM?

Reward Enhances Memory via Age-Varying Online and Offline Neural Mechanisms across Development	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	"Reward motivation enhances memory through interactions between mesolimbic, hippocampal, and cortical systems, both during and after encoding. Developmental changes in these distributed neural circuits may lead to age-related differences in reward-motivated memory and the underlying neural mechanisms. Converging evidence from cross-species studies suggests that subcortical dopamine signaling is increased during adolescence, which may lead to stronger memory representations of rewarding, relative to mundane, events and changes in the contributions of underlying subcortical and cortical brain mechanisms across age. Here, we used fMRI to examine how reward motivation influences the ""online "" encoding and ""offline "" postencoding brain mechanisms that support long-term associative memory from childhood to adulthood in human participants of both sexes. We found that reward motivation led to both age-invariant enhancements and nonlinear age-related differences in associative memory after 24 h. Furthermore, reward-related memory benefits were linked to age-varying neural mechanisms. During encoding, interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were associated with better high-reward memory to a greater degree with increasing age. Preencoding to postencoding changes in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and VTA were also associated with better high-reward memory, but more so at younger ages. Our findings suggest that there may be developmental differences in the contributions of offline subcortical and online cortical brain mechanisms supporting reward-motivated memory."	89	NA	89	NA	2	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression) after: clinical/psychological (high reward category of the task source image)	no			#NAAM?

However, the neural mechanisms underlying this susceptibility remain largely unclear. To address this gap, the current study aimed to identify the neural correlates of motion sickness susceptibility using multimodal MRI. First, we compared resting-state functional connectivity between healthy individuals who were highly susceptible to motion sickness (N = 36) and age/sex-matched controls who showed low susceptibility (N = 36). Seed-based analysis revealed between-group differences in functional connectivity of core vestibular regions in the left posterior Sylvian fissure. A data-driven approach using intrinsic connectivity contrast found greater network centrality of the left intraparietal sulcus in high- rather than in low-susceptible individuals. Moreover, exploratory structural connectivity analysis uncovered an association between motion sickness susceptibility and white matter integrity in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Taken together, our data indicate left parietal involvement in motion sickness susceptibility.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based

An Approach to Automatically Label and Order Brain Activity/Component Maps	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY	Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a brain imaging technique that provides detailed insights into brain function and its disruption in various brain disorders. The data-driven analysis of fMRI brain activity maps involves several postprocessing steps, the first of which is identifying whether the estimated brain network maps capture signals of interest, for example, intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), or artifacts. This is followed by linking the ICNs to standardized anatomical and functional parcellations. Optionally, as in the study of functional network connectivity (FNC), rearranging the connectivity graph is also necessary to facilitate interpretation.Methods: Here we develop a novel and efficient method (Autolabeler) for implementing and integrating all of these processes in a fully automated manner. The Autolabeler method is pretrained on a cross-validated elastic-net regularized general linear model from the noisecloud toolbox to separate neuroscientifically meaningful ICNs from artifacts. It is capable of automatically labeling activity maps with labels from several well-known anatomical and functional parcellations. Subsequently, this method also maximizes the modularity within functional domains to generate a more systematically structured FNC matrix for post hoc network analyses.Results: Results show that our pretrained model achieves 86% accuracy at classifying ICNs from artifacts in an independent validation data set. The automatic anatomical and functional labels also have a high degree of similarity with manual labels selected by human raters.Discussion: At a time of ever-increasing rates of generating brain imaging data and analyzing brain activity, the proposed Autolabeler method is intended to automate such analyses for faster and more reproducible research. Impact statementOur proposed method is capable of implementing and integrating some of the crucial tasks in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. It is the first to incorporate such tasks without the need for expert intervention. We develop an open-source toolbox for the proposed method that can function as stand-alone software and additionally provides seamless integration with the widely used group independent component analysis for fMRI toolbox (GIFT). This integration can aid investigators to conduct fMRI studies in an end-to-end automated manner.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Action Observation Responses Are Influenced by Movement Kinematics and Target Identity	CEREBRAL CORTEX	In order to inform the debate whether cortical areas related to action observation provide a pragmatic or a semantic representation of goal-directed actions, we performed 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments in humans. The first experiment, involving observation of aimless arm movements, resulted in activation of most of the components known to support action execution and action observation. Given the absence of a target/goal in this experiment and the activation of parieto-premotor cortical areas, which were associated in the past with direction, amplitude, and velocity of movement of biological effectors, our findings suggest that during action observation we could be monitoring movement kinematics. With the second, double dissociation fMRI experiment, we revealed the components of the observation-related cortical network affected by 1) actions that have the same target/goal but different reaching and grasping kinematics and 2) actions that have very similar kinematics but different targets/goals. We found that certain areas related to action observation, including the mirror neuron ones, are informed about movement kinematics and/or target identity, hence providing a pragmatic rather than a semantic representation of goal-directed actions. Overall, our findings support a process-driven simulation-like mechanism of action understanding, in agreement with the theory of motor cognition, and question motor theories of action concept processing.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?

Although its existence has been demonstrated in adolescents and adults, whether such individualized patterns exist during infancy is barely investigated despite its importance in identifying the origin of the intrinsic connectome patterns that potentially mirror distinct behavioral phenotypes. To fill this knowledge gap, capitalizing on a longitudinal high-resolution structural and resting-state functional MRI dataset with 104 human infants (53 females) with 806 longitudinal scans (age, 16-876 d) and infant-specific functional parcellation maps, we observe that the brain functional connectome fingerprint may exist since infancy and keeps stable over months during early brain development. Specifically, we achieve an -78% individual identification rate by using -5% selected functional connections, compared with the best identification rate of 60% without connection selection. The frontoparietal networks recognized as the most contributive networks in adult functional connectome fingerprinting retain their superiority in infants despite being widely acknowledged as rapidly developing systems during childhood. The existence and stability of the functional connectome fingerprint are further validated on adjacent age groups. Moreover, we show that the infant frontoparietal networks can reach similar accuracy in predicting individual early learning composite scores as the whole-brain connectome, again resembling the observations in adults and highlighting the relevance of functional connectome fingerprint to cognitive performance. For the first time, these results suggest that each individual may retain a unique and stable marker of functional connectome during early brain development.	104	NA	104	NA	602	NA	full correlation	individual	both used and not used	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, high-pass filtering) after: age, scan related (motion)	no			#NAAM?

Relating neural oscillations to laminar fMRI connectivity in visual cortex	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Laminar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds the potential to study connectivity at the laminar level in humans. Here we analyze simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and high-resolution fMRI data to investigate how EEG power modulations, induced by a task with an attentional component, relate to changes in fMRI laminar connectivity between and within brain regions in visual cortex. Our results indicate that our task-induced decrease in beta power relates to an increase in deep-to-deep layer coupling between regions and to an increase in deep/middle-to-superficial layer connectivity within brain regions. The attention-related alpha power decrease predominantly relates to reduced connectivity between deep and superficial layers within brain regions, since, unlike beta power, alpha power was found to be positively correlated to connectivity. We observed no strong relation between laminar connectivity and gamma band oscillations. These results indicate that especially beta band, and to a lesser extent, alpha band oscillations relate to laminar-specific fMRI connectivity. The differential effects for alpha and beta bands indicate that they relate to different feedback-related neural processes that are differentially expressed in intra-region laminar fMRI-based connectivity.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

However, it is unclear how the underlying functional organization of these brain networks is altered in ASD individuals. We tested four models of reduced laterality in a social communication network in 70 ASD individuals (14 females) and a control group of the same number of tightly matched typically developing (TD) individuals (19 females) using high-quality resting-state fMRI data and a method of measuring patterns of functional laterality across the brain. We found that a functionally defined social commu-nication network exhibited the typical pattern of left laterality in both groups, whereas there was a significant increase in within-relative to across-hemisphere connectivity of homotopic regions in the right hemisphere in ASD individuals. Furthermore, greater within-relative to across-hemisphere connectivity in the left hemisphere was positively correlated with a measure of verbal ability in both groups, whereas greater within-relative to across-hemisphere connectivity in the right hemisphere in ASD, but not TD, individuals was negatively correlated with the same verbal measure. Crucially, these differen-ces in patterns of laterality were not found in two other functional networks and were specifically correlated to a measure of verbal ability but not metrics of other core components of the ASD phenotype. These results suggest that previous reports of reduced laterality in social communication regions in ASD is because of the two hemispheres functioning more independently than seen in TD individuals, with the atypical right-hemisphere network component being maladaptive.	140	70	70	NA	2	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), other (IQ (sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological (cardiac and respiration measures, nuisance covariate regression) after: age, scan related (motion), clinical/psychological (task performance on WASI subtests)	no			#NAAM?

Tau is assumed to spread prion-like across connected neurons, but the mechanisms of tau propagation are largely elusive in 4-repeat tauopathies, characterized not only by neuronal but also by astroglial and oligodendroglial tau accumulation. Here, we assess whether connectivity is associated with 4R-tau deposition patterns by combining resting-state fMRI connectomics with both 2(nd) generation F-18-PI-2620 tau-PET in 46 patients with clinically diagnosed 4-repeat tauopathies and post-mortem cell-type-specific regional tau assessments from two independent progressive supranuclear palsy patient samples (n = 97 and n = 96). We find that inter-regional connectivity is associated with higher inter-regional correlation of both tau-PET and post-mortem tau levels in 4-repeat tauopathies. In regional cell-type specific post-mortem tau assessments, this association is stronger for neuronal than for astroglial or oligodendroglial tau, suggesting that connectivity is primarily associated with neuronal tau accumulation. Using tau-PET we find further that patient-level tau patterns are associated with the connectivity of subcortical tau epicenters. Together, the current study provides combined in vivo tau-PET and histopathological evidence that brain connectivity is associated with tau deposition patterns in 4-repeat tauopathies. Tau pathology drives neuronal dysfunction in 4- repeat tauopathies. Here, the authors combine tau-PET, resting-state fMRI and histopathology data, to show that brain connectivity is associated with tau deposition patterns in 4-repeat tauopathies.	69	NA	NA	- network constructed from n= 69 HC - sample size reported in abstract differs	232	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)  after: other (inter-regional Euclidean distance (=distance between ROI centers of mass))	no			"- weights: ""... shuffling the functional connectivity matrices while preserving the overall degree- and weight-distribution..."" - selection: no mention"					
Schroder, R and Keidel, K and Trautner, P and Radbruch, A and Ettinger, U and Schroeder, Rebekka and Keidel, Kristof and Trautner, Peter and Radbruch, Alexander and Ettinger, Ulrich	Neural mechanisms of background and velocity effects in smooth pursuit eye movements	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are essential to guide behaviour in complex visual environments. SPEM accuracy is known to be degraded by the presence of a structured visual background and at higher target velocities. The aim of this preregistered study was to investigate the neural mechanisms of these robust behavioural effects. N = 33 participants performed a SPEM task with two background conditions (present and absent) at two target velocities (0.4 and 0.6 Hz). Eye movement and BOLD data were collected simultaneously. Both the presence of a structured background and faster target velocity decreased pursuit gain and increased catch-up saccade rate. Faster targets additionally increased position error. Higher BOLD response with background was found in extensive clusters in visual, parietal, and frontal areas (including the medial frontal eye fields; FEF) partially overlapping with the known SPEM network. Faster targets were associated with higher BOLD response in visual cortex and left lateral FEF. Task-based functional connectivity analyses (psychophysiological interactions; PPI) largely replicated previous results in the basic SPEM network but did not yield additional information regarding the neural underpinnings of the background and velocity effects. The results show that the presentation of visual background stimuli during SPEM induces activity in a widespread visuo-parieto-frontal network including areas contributing to cognitive aspects of oculomotor control such as medial FEF, whereas the response to higher target velocity involves visual and motor areas such as lateral FEF. Therefore, we were able to propose for the first time different functions of the medial and lateral FEF during SPEM.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

A mixed-modeling framework for whole-brain dynamic network analysis	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE	Author Summary In recent years, a growing body of studies have aimed at analyzing the brain as a complex dynamic system by using various neuroimaging data. This has opened new avenues to answer compelling questions about the brain function in health and disease. However, methods that allow for providing statistical inference about how the complex interactions of the brain are associated with desired phenotypes are to be developed for a more profound insight. This study introduces a promising regression-based model to relate dynamic brain networks to desired phenotypes and provide statistical inference. Moreover, it can be used for simulating dynamic brain networks with respect to desired phenotypes at the group and individual levels. The emerging area of dynamic brain network analysis has gained considerable attention in recent years. However, development of multivariate statistical frameworks that allow for examining the associations between phenotypic traits and dynamic patterns of system-level properties of the brain, and drawing statistical inference about such associations, has largely lagged behind. To address this need we developed a mixed-modeling framework that allows for assessing the relationship between any desired phenotype and dynamic patterns of whole-brain connectivity and topology. This novel framework also allows for simulating dynamic brain networks with respect to desired covariates. Unlike current tools, which largely use data-driven methods, our model-based method enables aligning neuroscientific hypotheses with the analytic approach. We demonstrate the utility of this model in identifying the relationship between fluid intelligence and dynamic brain networks by using resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) data from 200 participants in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) study. We also demonstrate the utility of this model to simulate dynamic brain networks at both group and individual levels. To our knowledge, this approach provides the first model-based statistical method for examining dynamic patterns of system-level properties of the brain and their relationships to phenotypic traits as well as simulating dynamic brain networks.	389	NA	NA	NA	268	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)  after: sex, age, physiological/biological (BMI), clinical/psychological (alcohol abuse and dependence), other (smoking status, race, ethnicity, handedness, income, spatial distance between nodes)	no			#NAAM?					
Bathelt, J and Geurts, HM and Borsboom, D and Bathelt, Joe and Geurts, Hilde M. and Borsboom, Denny	More than the sum of its parts: Merging network psychometrics and network neuroscience with application in autism	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE	Author Summary The article introduces a method to combine common practices in network psychometrics and network neuroimaging. Namely, we use the unique variance in behavioural measures as regressors to identify unique neural correlates. This enables the description of brain-level and behavioural-level data into a joint network while keeping the dimensionality of the results manageable and interpretable. We illustrate this approach by showing the network of autistic traits and their correlates in resting-state functional connectivity. Network approaches that investigate the interaction between symptoms and behaviours have opened new ways of understanding psychological phenomena in health and disorder in recent years. In parallel, network approaches that characterise the interaction between brain regions have become the dominant approach in neuroimaging research. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for combining network psychometrics and network neuroscience. This approach utilises the information from the psychometric network to obtain neural correlates that are associated with each node in the psychometric network (network-based regression). Moreover, we combine the behavioural variables and their neural correlates in a joint network to characterise their interactions. We illustrate the approach by highlighting the interaction between the triad of autistic traits and their resting-state functional connectivity associations. To this end, we utilise data from 172 male autistic participants (10-21 years) from the autism brain data exchange (ABIDE, ABIDE-II) that completed resting-state fMRI and were assessed using the autism diagnostic interview (ADI-R). Our results indicate that the network-based regression approach can uncover both unique and shared neural correlates of behavioural measures. For instance, our example analysis indicates that the overlap between communication and social difficulties is not reflected in the overlap between their functional brain correlates.	172	NA	172	#NAAM?	446	NA	multiple	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering, nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression) during: age, scan related (motion), physiological/biological (GM volume and ICV), other (site, spatial root-mean-square of the data after temporal differencing (DVARS). regressed from each edge. 	no			- 4 network parcellations: 192, 284, 376, 932, average filled in network size  - 3 association types: Full correlation, Partial correlation, Tangent-space embedding

To validate our framework, several metrics from graph theory are expanded and adapted to our specific domain characteristics. This proof of concept was applied to a cohort of people with multiple sclerosis, and results show that some brain regions with a synchronized connectivity deterioration could be identified. In recent years, research on network analysis applied to MRI data has advanced significantly. However, the majority of the studies are limited to single networks obtained from resting-state fMRI, diffusion MRI, or gray matter probability maps derived from T1 images. Although a limited number of previous studies have combined two of these networks, none have introduced a framework to combine morphological, structural, and functional brain connectivity networks. The aim of this study was to combine the morphological, structural, and functional information, thus defining a new multilayer network perspective. This has proved advantageous when jointly analyzing multiple types of relational data from the same objects simultaneously using graph- mining techniques. The main contribution of this research is the design, development, and validation of a framework that merges these three layers of information into one multilayer network that links and relates the integrity of white matter connections with gray matter probability maps and resting-state fMRI. To validate our framework, several metrics from graph theory are expanded and adapted to our specific domain characteristics. This proof of concept was applied to a cohort of people with multiple sclerosis, and results show that several brain regions with a synchronized connectivity deterioration could be identified.	143	125	18	NA	76	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes (absolutised)	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering) after: age, gender	no			confounders age and gender regressed out in an intermediate step after network estimation and before further statistical analysis.

Altered default mode network associated with pesticide exposure in Latinx children from rural farmworker families	NEUROIMAGE	Pesticide exposure has been associated with adverse cognitive and neurological effects. However, neuroimaging studies aimed at examining the impacts of pesticide exposure on brain networks underlying abnormal neurodevel-opment in children remain limited. It has been demonstrated that pesticide exposure in children is associated with disrupted brain anatomy in regions that make up the default mode network (DMN), a subnetwork engaged across a diverse set of cognitive processes, particularly higher-order cognitive tasks. This study tested the hypothesis that functional brain network connectivity/topology in Latinx children from rural farmworker families (FW chil-dren) would differ from urban Latinx children from non-farmworker families (NFW children). We also tested the hypothesis that probable historic childhood exposure to pesticides among FW children would be associated with network connectivity/topology in a manner that parallels differences between FW and NFW children. We used brain networks from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 78 children and a mixed-effects regression framework to test our hypotheses. We found that network topology was differently associated with the connection probability between FW and NFW children in the DMN. Our results also indicated that, among 48 FW children, historic reports of exposure to pesticides from prenatal to 96 months old were significantly associ-ated with DMN topology, as hypothesized. Although the cause of the differences in brain networks between FW and NFW children cannot be determined using a cross-sectional study design, the observed associations between network connectivity/topology and historic exposure reports in FW children provide compelling evidence for a contribution of pesticide exposure on altering the DMN network organization in this vulnerable population. Al-though longitudinal follow-up of the children is necessary to further elucidate the cause and reveal the ultimate neurological implications, these findings raise serious concerns about the potential adverse health consequences from developmental neurotoxicity associated with pesticide exposure in this vulnerable population.	78	NA	NA	- two groups: 48 + 30	268	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (negative edges set to 0)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: other (SES (sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological (band pass filtering) after: other (distance between ROIs, child and maternal education, maternal race, parent's occupation)	no			"- modeling: could be hierarchical - 2.7 mentions ""representative group network generation"" where they don't use averaging across subjects but apply probabilities of edges "

A dynamic gradient architecture generates brain activity states	NEUROIMAGE	The human brain exhibits a diverse yet constrained range of activity states. While these states can be faithfully represented in a low-dimensional latent space, our understanding of the constitutive functional anatomy is still evolving. Here we applied dimensionality reduction to task-free and task fMRI data to address whether latent dimensions reflect intrinsic systems and if so, how these systems may interact to generate different activity states. We find that each dimension represents a dynamic activity gradient, including a primary unipolar sensory-association gradient underlying the global signal. The gradients appear stable across individuals and cognitive states, while recapitulating key functional connectivity properties including anticorrelation, modularity, and regional hubness. We then use dynamical systems modeling to show that gradients causally interact via statespecific coupling parameters to create distinct brain activity patterns. Together, these findings indicate that a set of dynamic, intrinsic spatial gradients interact to determine the repertoire of possible brain activity states.	200	NA	NA	- 100 discovery +100 validation	273	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related  (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX denoising, band pass filtering) after: other (FC strength (when estimating partial correlations between actual FC and simulated FC))	no			- aggregated based on fig 5 c

Several studies have shown that time of day (TOD) is associated with human cognition and brain functions. In this study, utilizing a chronotype-based paradigm, we applied a graph theory approach on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data to compare wholebrain functional network topology between morning and evening sessions and between morning-type (MT) and evening-type (ET) participants. Sixty-two individuals (31 MT and 31 ET) underwent two fMRI sessions, approximately 1 hour (morning) and 10 h (evening) after their wake-up time, according to their declared habitual sleep-wake pattern on a regular working day. In the global analysis, the findings revealed the effect of TOD on functional connectivity (FC) patterns, including increased small-worldness, assortativity, and synchronization across the day. However, we identified no significant differences based on chronotype categories. The study of the modular structure of the brain at mesoscale showed that functional networks tended to be more integrated with one another in the evening session than in the morning session. Local/regional changes were affected by both factors (i.e., TOD and chronotype), mostly in areas associated with somatomotor, attention, frontoparietal, and default networks. Furthermore, connectivity and hub analyses revealed that the somatomotor, ventral attention, and visual networks covered the most highly connected areas in the morning and evening sessions: the latter two were more active in the morning sessions, and the first was identified as being more active in the evening. Finally, we performed a correlation analysis to determine whether global and nodal measures were associated with subjective assessments across participants. Collectively, these findings contribute to an increased understanding of diurnal fluctuations in resting brain activity and highlight the role of TOD in future studies on brain function and the design of fMRI experiments.	62	NA	62	- 31 (MT) + 31 (ET)	200	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (negative edges set to 0)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering) after: age, gender, clinical/psychological (clinical variables)	no

The functional connectivity in depression is affected by the cumulative effect of course of illness. However, previous neuroimaging studies on abnormal functional connection have not mainly focused on the disease duration, which is seen as a secondary factor. Here, we used a data-driven analysis (multivariate distance matrix regression) to examine the relationship between the course of illness and resting-state functional dysconnectivity in MDD. This method identified a region in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is most linked to course of illness. Specifically, follow-up seed analyses show this phenomenon resulted from the individual differences in the topological distribution of three networks. In individuals with short-duration MDD, the connection to the default mode network was strong. By contrast, individuals with long-duration MDD showed hyperconnectivity to the ventral attention network and the frontoparietal network. These results emphasized the centrality of the anterior cingulate cortex in the pathophysiology of the increased course of illness and implied critical links between network topography and pathological duration. Thus, dissociable patterns of connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex is an important dimension feature of the disease process of depression.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- individual connectivity matrices calculated for subjects, which are then compared with each other to create a distance matrix - does not imply aggregated, right? - no network size mentioned  - no selection mentioned	Voxel-wise functional connectivity analysis (between each voxel with each other voxel in the brain's grey matter). 				
Gbadeyan, O and Teng, J and Prakash, RS and Gbadeyan, Oyetunde and Teng, James and Prakash, Ruchika Shaurya	Predicting response time variability from task and resting-state functional connectivity in the aging brain	NEUROIMAGE	"Aging is associated with declines in a host of cognitive functions, including attentional control, inhibitory con-trol, episodic memory, processing speed, and executive functioning. Theoretical models attribute the age-related decline in cognitive functioning to deficits in goal maintenance and attentional inhibition. Despite these well-documented declines in executive control resources, older adults endorse fewer episodes of mind-wandering when assessed using task-embedded thought probes. Furthermore, previous work on the neural basis of mind-wandering has mostly focused on young adults with studies predominantly focusing on the activity and connectivity of a select few canonical networks. However, whole-brain functional networks associated with mind-wandering in aging have not yet been characterized. In this study, using response time variability -the trial-to-trial fluctu-ations in behavioral responses -as an indirect marker of mind-wandering or an ""out-of-the-zone "" attentional state representing suboptimal behavioral performance, we show that brain-based predictive models of response time variability can be derived from whole-brain task functional connectivity. In contrast, models derived from resting-state functional connectivity alone did not predict individual response time variability. Finally, we show that despite successful within-sample prediction of response time variability, our models did not generalize to predict response time variability in independent cohorts of older adults with resting-state connectivity. Over-all, our findings provide evidence for the utility of task-based functional connectivity in predicting individual response time variability in aging. Future research is needed to derive more robust and generalizable models."	150	75	75	NA	47	NA	full correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, high pass filtering) after: age, sex, scan related (motion), other (site, cross-validation approach, parcellation scheme)	no			- most info in figure 2

A connectome can become more individualized either by increasing self-stability or decreasing between-subject-similarity. Here we used a longitudinal early childhood dataset to investigate age associations with connectome self-stability, between -subject-similarity, and developmental individualization, defined as an individual's self-stability across a 12-month interval relative to their between-subject-similarity. fMRI data were collected during an 18-minute passive view-ing scan from 73 typically developing children aged 4-7 years, at baseline and 12-month follow-up. We found that young children had highly individualized connectomes, with sufficient self-stability across 12-months for 98% identification accuracy. Linear models showed a significant relationship between age and developmental individualization across the whole brain and in most networks. This association appeared to be largely driven by an increase in self-stability with age, with only weak evidence for relationships between age and similarity across participants. Together our findings suggest that children's connectomes become more individualized across early childhood, and that this effect is driven by increasing self-stability rather than decreasing between-subject -similarity.	73	NA	73	NA	1095	12	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering, global signal regression)  after: other (network size)	no			"- 1095 nodes in 12 networks  - edge selection was used in construction of control networks: ""To account for differences in network size (number of nodes in each network), we conducted network size-matched control analyses by randomly choosing 36 nodes (chosen as it was close to but smaller than the 39 nodes in our smallest network) from each network and only using the (630) edges between those nodes, sampled 1000 times.""

This is true even when this information is neutral with respect to schema-driven expectations. This assimilation of novel information into schemata has been attributed to more effective organizational processing that leads to more referential connections with the activated associative schema network. Animal data suggest that systems consolidation of novel assimilated information is also accelerated. In the current study, we used both multivariate and univariate fMRI analyses to provide further support for these proposals and to elucidate the neural underpinning of these processes. Twenty-eight participants (5 male) overlearned fictitious schemata for 7 weeks and then encoded novel related and control facts in the scanner. These facts were retrieved both immediately and 2 weeks later, also in the scanner. Our results conceptually replicate previous findings with respect to enhanced vmPFC???hippocampus coupling during encoding of novel related information and point to a prior knowledge effect that is distinct from situations where novel information is experienced as congruent or incongruent with a schema. Moreover, the combination of both multivariate and univariate results further specified the proposed contributions of the vmPFC, precuneus and angular gyrus network to the more efficient encoding of schema-related information. In addition, our data provide further evidence for more efficient systems consolidation of such novel schema-related and potentially assimilated information.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Gruskin, DC and Patel, GH and Gruskin, David C. and Patel, Gaurav H.	Brain connectivity at rest predicts individual differences in normative activity during movie watching	NEUROIMAGE	When exposed to the same sensory event, some individuals are bound to have less typical experiences than others. Previous research has investigated this phenomenon by showing that the typicality of one's sensory experience is associated with the typicality of their stimulus-evoked brain activity (as measured by intersubject correlation, or ISC). Individual differences in ISC have recently been attributed to variability in focal neural processing. However, the extent to which these differences reflect purely intra-regional variability versus variation in the brain's baseline ability to transmit information between regions has yet to be established. Here, we show that an individual's degree and spatial distribution of ISC are closely related to their brain's functional organization at rest. Using resting state and movie watching fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we reveal that resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) profiles can be used to predict cortex-wide ISC. Similar region-level analyses demonstrate that the levels of ISC exhibited by brain regions during movie watching are associated with their connectivity to other regions at rest, and that the nature of these connectivity-activity relationships varies as a function of regional roles in sensory information processing. Finally, we show that an individual's unique spatial distribution of ISC, independent of its magnitude, is also related to their RSFC profile. These findings contextualize reports of localized individual differences in ISC as potentially reflecting larger, network level alterations in resting brain function and detail how the brain's ability to process complex sensory information is linked to its baseline functional organization.	176	NA	176	NA	360	NA	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX denoising, low- and high-pass filtering) after: scan related (tSNR, motion), other (global intrasubject correlation between sessions)	no			#NAAM?

However, these studies assumed that each brain region belonged to a single functional module, although there has been convergent evidence supporting the existence of overlap among functional modules in the human brain. To reveal how age affects the overlapping functional modular organization, this study applied an overlapping module detection algorithm that requires no prior knowledge to the resting-state fMRI data of a healthy cohort ( N = 570) aged from 18 to 88 years old. A series of measures were derived to delineate the characteristics of the overlapping modular structure and the set of overlapping nodes (brain regions participating in two or more modules) identified from each participant. Age-related regression analyses on these measures found linearly decreasing trends in the overlapping modularity and the modular similarity. The number of overlapping nodes was found increasing with age, but the increment was not even over the brain. In addition, across the adult lifespan and within each age group, the nodal overlapping probability consistently had positive correlations with both functional gradient and flexibility. Further, by correlation and mediation analyses, we showed that the influence of age on memory-related cognitive performance might be explained by the change in the overlapping functional modular organization. Together, our results revealed age-related decreased segregation from the brain functional overlapping modular organization perspective, which could provide new insight into the adult lifespan changes in brain function and the influence of such changes on cognitive performance.	570	NA	NA	NA	264	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	no	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band pass filtering)  after: gender, scan related (motion)	no			- first negative values were set to 0, then thresholded and binarized 			difficult - they form (full?) correlation matrices first and then the GLMM is kind of a higher level analysis (group level..?)	exclude: they model functional dynamics using the graph laplacian (the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix) or better the multiple laplacians that could explain the observed activity clusters, and validate those functional connectivities with real data.

Moreover, their analysis depends on functional activity clusters, which I doubt would be similarly present in resting-state.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is well suited for the concurrent application during rTMS treatment sessions to capture immediate blood oxygenation (oxy-Hb) effects, however limited in spatial resolution. Objective: To understand the network effects behind such a prefrontal fNIRS response during rTMS, and to test whether the fNIRS signal may be predictive of treatment response, we linked data from fNIRS and fMRI within a clinical intervention study. Methods: 42 patients with ongoing depression were recruited and randomized to receive active or sham intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) twice daily for ten days at target intensity. Oxy-Hb was recorded with fNIRS during the first, fifth, and final day of iTBS, with the probe holders located laterally to the TMS coil over regions corresponding to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Resting-state fMRI scanning was performed before and after the whole iTBS treatment course. Functional connectivity analyses were then performed using dlPFC seeds from parcels of a brain atlas showing most overlap with the fNIRS probe locations during treatment. Results: After active iTBS, left dlPFC-connectivity to the right insula/operculum was reduced compared to sham. The left insula showed a connectivity reduction to the left dlPFC that correlated with an improvement in symptoms. In addition, the posterior parietal cortex showed a connectivity reduction to the left dlPFC that correlated with the fNIRS signal following active iTBS. Finally, the fNIRS oxy-Hb signal from the left dlPFC-seed during the first treatment day was predictive of dlPFC-connectivity change to precentral and temporal cortex regions. Conclusion: By linking findings from these two different methods, this study suggests that changes within both the salience network and the central executive network affect the fNIRS response to iTBS.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?					
Su, J and Jia, WB and Wan, XH and Su, Jie and Jia, Wenbin and Wan, Xiaohong	Task-Specific Neural Representations of Generalizable Metacognitive Control Signals in the Human Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a critical role in cognitive control over different domains of tasks. The dACC activities uniformly represent task-generic intensities of control signals across different tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the dACC activities could also encode task identities of control signals across different tasks. If so, how the two types of control information are coherently organized in the dACC? Decision uncertainty is an internally-generated control signal by retrospective monitoring, namely, metacognition, even with no external feedback. We here investigated neural representations of decision uncertainty accompanying three decision-making tasks in the domains of perception, rule-based inference, and memory using trial-by-trial univariate and multivariate analyses on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired on human male and female healthy subjects. Our results demonstrated that the dACC represented decision uncertainty commonly across the three decision-making tasks. Further, the multivariate fMRI analyses revealed a mosaic form of neural representations of decision uncertainty across tasks in the dACC. The identity and intensity information was separately represented in two dissociable components, the high-dimensional pattern and the scalar magnitude, of the dACC multivoxel fMRI activities. Lastly, a follow-up behavioral experiment confirmed that this mosaic form of neural representations of parallelly existing decision uncertainty across different tasks should lead to mutual interferences more on the intensity, but less on the identity of control signals. Thus, our findings suggest that the dACC with the mosaic form of neural representations could provide task-generic and task-specific metacognitive control signals to guide appropriate control on different decision-making tasks.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

A total of 181 patients with MMD were enrolled, including 57 with left limb paresthesia (MLP group), 61 with right limb paresthesia (MRP group), and 63 without paresthesia (MWP group). Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) was performed in 20 of the 57 patients with left limb pares-thesia and 15 of the 61 patients with right limb paresthesia. Twenty-nine age-and sex-matched healthy controls (HC group) were recruited during the same period. All participants underwent rs-fMRI examination, and the patients treated with EDAS were re-examined 3-4 months after the surgery. After data preprocessing, we selected Brodmann area 3 on each side of the brain as the seed region to construct a functional connectivity network of the whole brain, and then we analyzed the differences in functional connectivity between the HC group, MWP group, MLP group, and MRP group. The functional connectivity of Brodmann area 3 (on either side) with the ipsilateral frontal (superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus) and parietal (supra -marginal gyrus, angular gyrus, and superior parietal lobule) cortices was increased among patients with MMD. The functional connectivity enhancement in these brain regions was broader and greater in patients with contralateral limb paresthesia than in patients without paresthesia, and the regions with functional connectivity changes were roughly distributed symmetrically among the MLP group and the MRP group. There were no changes 3-4 months after EDAS in the increased functional connectivity between the frontal and parietal cortices and Brodmann area 3. Limb paresthesia in patients with MMD may be driven by abnormal functional connec-tivity in the frontal and parietal cortices. Functional changes in associated brain regions may be a target for evaluating the severity of MMD and its response to treatment.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

This work ex-plored whether a combination of structural and functional connectivity can improve the fit of regression models of cognitive performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was first applied to cognitive data from the Hu-man Connectome Project to identify latent cognitive components: Executive Function, Self-regulation, Language, Encoding and Sequence Processing. A Principal Component Regression approach with embedded Step-Wise Re-gression (SWR-PCR) was then used to fit regression models of each cognitive domain based on structural (SC), functional (FC) or combined structural-functional (CC) connectivity. Executive Function was best explained by the CC model. Self-regulation was equally well explained by SC and FC. Language was equally well explained by CC and FC models. Encoding and Sequence Processing were best explained by SC. Evaluation of out-of-sample models' skill via cross-validation showed that SC, FC and CC produced generalisable models of Language perfor-mance. SC models performed most effectively at predicting Language performance in unseen sample. Executive Function was most effectively predicted by SC models, followed only by CC models. Self-regulation was only effectively predicted by CC models and Sequence Processing was only effectively predicted by FC models. The present study demonstrates that integrating structural and functional connectivity can help explaining cognitive performance, but that the added explanatory value (in-sample) may be domain-specific and can come at the expense of reduced generalisation performance (out-of-sample).	249	NA	NA	NA	278	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, low- and high-pass filtering)  after: age, gender, other (education)	no

Hippocampal Threat Reactivity Interacts with Physiological Arousal to Predict PTSD Symptoms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE	Hippo campal impairments are reliably associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, little research has characterized how increased threat sensitivity may interact with arousal responses to alter hippocampal reactivity, and further how these interactions relate to the sequelae of trauma-related symptoms. In a sample of individuals recently exposed to trauma (N = 116, 76 female), we found that PTSD symptoms at 2 weeks were associated with decreased hippocampal responses to threat as assessed with fMRI. Further, the relationship between hippocampal threat sensitivity and PTSD symp-tomology only emerged in individuals who showed transient, high threat-related arousal, as assayed by an independently col-lected measure of fear potentiated startle. Collectively, our finding suggests that development of PTSD is associated with threat-related decreases in hippocampal function because of increases in fear-potentiated arousal.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?			this is task-based functional connectivity, didn't we exclude?

Yet, research on longitudinal trajectories of FC changes of the DMN in healthy aging is less conclusive. For the present study, we used a resting state functional MRI dataset drawn from the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain Database Project (LHAB) collected in 5 occasions over a course of 7 years (baseline N = 232, age range: 64-87 y, mean age = 70.85 y). FC strength changes within the DMN and its regions were investigated using a network-based statistical method suitable for the analysis of longitudinal data. The average DMN FC strength remained stable, however, various DMN components showed differential age-and time-related effects. Our results revealed a complex pattern of longitudinal change seen as decreases and increases of FC strength encompassing the majority of DMN regions, while age-related effects were negative and present in select brain areas. These findings testify to the growing importance of longitudinal studies using more sophisticated fine-grained tools needed to highlight the complexity of the functional reorganization of DMN with healthy aging.	232	NA	232	NA	100	7	full correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering)  after: age, sex, scan related (motion), other (time, education)	no			- 100 parcels assigned to 7 networks

However, visuo-attentional processing abnormalities have been described as well. The goal of the present study was to determine the involvement of visual attention during fluent reading in children with dyslexia and typical readers. Here, 75 children (8-12 years old; 36 typical readers, 39 children with dyslexia) completed cognitive and reading assessments. Neuroimaging data were acquired while children performed a fluent reading task with (a) a condition where the text remained on the screen (Still) versus (b) a condition in which the letters were being deleted (Deleted). Cognitive assessment data analysis revealed that visual attention, executive functions, and phonological awareness significantly contributed to reading comprehension in both groups. A seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analysis was performed on the fluency functional magnetic resonance imaging task. Typical readers showed greater functional connectivity between the dorsal attention network and the left angular gyrus while performing the Still and Deleted reading tasks versus children with dyslexia. Higher connectivity values were associated with higher reading comprehension. The control group showed increased functional connectivity between the ventral attention network and the fronto-parietal network during the Deleted text condition (compared with the Still condition). Children with dyslexia did not display this pattern. The results suggest that the synchronized activity of executive, visual attention, and reading-related networks is a pattern of functional integration which children with dyslexia fail to achieve. The present evidence points toward a critical role of visual attention in dyslexia.	75	NA	NA	NA										yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		seed to voxel

Through language disorders studies, many candidate genes were identified. However, such complex and multifactorial trait is unlikely to be driven by only few genes and case-control studies, suffering from a lack of power, struggle to uncover significant variants. In parallel, neuroimaging has significantly contributed to the understanding of structural and functional aspects of language in the human brain and the recent availability of large scale cohorts like UK Biobank have made possible to study language via image-derived endophenotypes in the general population. Because of its strong relationship with task-based fMRI (tbfMRI) activations and its easiness of acquisition, resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) have been more popularised, making it a good surrogate of functional neuronal processes. Taking advantage of such a synergistic system by aggregating effects across spatially distributed traits, we performed a multivariate genome-wide association study (mvGWAS) between genetic variations and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of classical brain language areas in the inferior frontal (pars opercularis, triangularis and orbitalis), temporal and inferior parietal lobes (angular and supramarginal gyri), in 32,186 participants from UK Biobank. Twenty genomic loci were found associated with language FCs, out of which three were replicated in an independent replication sample. A locus in 3p11.1, regulating EPHA3 gene expression, is found associated with FCs of the semantic component of the language network, while a locus in 15q14, regulating THBS1 gene expression is found associated with FCs of the perceptual-motor language processing, bringing novel insights into the neurobiology of language.	32186	NA	NA	NA	25	NA	partial correlation	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX denoising, high-pass filtering)  after: age, sex, physiological/biological (10 genetic principal components), other (site, genotype array type)	no			"- association: ""shrunk estimate of partial correlation"""

Predicting brain age from functional connectivity in symptomatic and preclinical Alzheimer disease	NEUROIMAGE	Brain-predicted age  quantifies apparent brain age compared to normative neuroimaging trajectories. Advanced brain-predicted age has been well established in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), but is underexplored in preclinical AD. Prior brain-predicted age studies have typically used structural MRI, but resting-state functional connectivity (FC) remains underexplored. Our model predicted age from FC in 391 cognitively normal, amyloid-negative controls (ages 18-89). We applied the trained model to 145 amyloid-negative, 151 preclinical AD, and 156 symptomatic AD participants to test group differences. The model accurately predicted age in the training set. FC-predicted brain age gaps (FC-BAG) were significantly older in symptomatic AD and significantly younger in preclinical AD compared to controls. There was minimal correspondence between networks predictive of age and AD. Elevated FC-BAG may reflect network disruption during symptomatic AD. Reduced FC-BAG in preclinical AD was opposite to the expected direction, and may reflect a biphasic response to preclinical AD pathology or may be driven by inconsistency between age-related vs. AD-related networks. Overall, FC-predicted brain age may be a sensitive AD biomarker.	391	NA	391	#NAAM?	300	16	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering)  after: age, sex, other (education, race)	no			- 300 regions and 16 networks - only use FC matrix for predictive model  - no mention of edge selection

Cross-Frequency Coupling in Childhood Absence Epilepsy	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY	"Objective: Absence seizures are the prototypic primarily generalized seizures, but there is incomplete understanding regarding their generation and maintenance. A core network for absence seizures has been defined, including focal cortical and thalamic regions that have frequency-dependent interactions. The purpose of this study was to investigate within-frequency coupling and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) during human absence seizures, to identify key regions (hubs) within the absence network that contribute to propagation and maintenance. Methods: Thirteen children with new-onset and untreated childhood absence epilepsy had over 60 typical absence seizures during both electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. The spatial map of the ictal network was defined using fMRI and used as prior information for MEG connectivity. A multilayer network approach was used to investigate within-frequency coupling and CFC for canonical frequency bands. A rigorous null-modeling approach was used to determine connections outside the noise floor. Results: Strong coupling between beta and gamma frequencies, within the left frontal cortex, and between the left frontal and right parietal regions was observed. There was also strong connectivity between left frontal and right parietal nodes within the gamma band. Multilayer versatility analysis identified a cluster of network hubs in the left frontal region. Interpretation: Cortical regions commonly identified as being critical for absence seizure generation (frontal cortex, precuneus) have strong CFC and within-frequency coupling between beta and gamma bands. As nonpharmacologic treatments, such as neuromodulation, become available for generalized epilepsies, detailed mechanistic understanding of how ""diffuse"" seizures are generated and maintained will be necessary to provide optimal outcomes."														yes	wrong outcome (acquisition)		- wrong outcome (acquitision)  - MEG focused, fMRI only used to identify network of interest

Accounting for motion in resting-state fMRI: What part of the spectrum are we characterizing in autism spectrum disorder?	NEUROIMAGE	The exclusion of high-motion participants can reduce the impact of motion in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, the exclusion of high-motion participants may change the distribution of clinically relevant variables in the study sample, and the resulting sample may not be representative of the population. Our goals are two-fold: 1) to document the biases introduced by common motion exclusion practices in functional connectivity research and 2) to introduce a framework to address these biases by treating excluded scans as a missing data problem. We use a study of autism spectrum disorder in children without an intellectual disability to illustrate the problem and the potential solution. We aggregated data from 545 children (8-13 years old) who participated in resting-state fMRI studies at Kennedy Krieger Institute (173 autistic and 372 typically developing) between 2007 and 2020. We found that autistic children were more likely to be excluded than typically developing children, with 28.5% and 16.1% of autistic and typically developing children excluded, respectively, using a lenient criterion and 81.0% and 60.1% with a stricter criterion. The resulting sample of autistic children with usable data tended to be older, have milder social deficits, better motor control, and higher intellectual ability than the original sample. These measures were also related to functional connectivity strength among children with usable data. This suggests that the generalizability of previous studies reporting naive analyses (i.e., based only on participants with usable data) may be limited by the selection of older children with less severe clinical profiles because these children are better able to remain still during an rs-fMRI scan. We adapt doubly robust targeted minimum loss based estimation with an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to address these data losses and the resulting biases. The proposed approach selects more edges that differ in functional connectivity between autistic and typically developing children than the naive approach, supporting this as a promising solution to improve the study of heterogeneous populations in which motion is common.	545	173	372	NA	30	NA	partial correlation	aggregated	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, signal drift) during: physiological (by using partial correlations for network estimation), sex, scan related (motion), other (race, SES) after: age, clinical/psychological (primary diagnosis, secondary diagnosis of ADHD, medication use, motor overflow, GAI, DuPaul inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores, ADOS) 	no			#NAAM?			difficult - diffusion map embedding?	exclude: the gradient embedding does not really look at connectivity, but changes in connectivity along a spatial gradient.

Previously, we reported behavioral effects of a 3-day visuospatial memory training with concurrent anodal tDCS over the right temporoparietal cortex in older adults. To investigate intervention-induced neural alterations we here used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets available from 35 participants of this previous study, acquired before and after the intervention. To delineate changes in whole-brain functional network architecture, we employed eigenvector centrality mapping. Gray matter alterations were analyzed using DTI-derived mean diffusivity (MD). Network centrality in the bilateral posterior temporooccipital cortex was reduced after anodal compared to sham stimulation. This focal effect is indicative of decreased functional connectivity of the brain region underneath the anodal electrode and its left-hemispheric homolog with other ""relevant"" (i.e., highly connected) brain regions, thereby providing evidence for reorganizational processes within the brain's network architecture. Examining local MD changes in these clusters, an interaction between stimulation condition and training success indicated a decrease of MD in the right (stimulated) temporooccipital cluster in individuals who showed superior behavioral training benefits. Using a data-driven whole-brain network approach, we provide evidence for targeted neuromodulatory effects of a combined tDCS-and-training intervention. We show for the first time that gray matter alterations of microstructure (assessed by DTI-derived MD) may be involved in tDCS-enhanced cognitive training. Increased knowledge on how combined interventions modulate neural networks in older adults, will help the development of specific therapeutic interventions against age-associated cognitive decline."														yes	missing information		#NAAM?

Regional age-related differences were strongly correlated within the structurally defined node neighborhood. The overall pattern of thickness differences was found to be anchored in the functional network hierarchy as encoded by macroscale functional connectivity gradients. Lastly, the iden-tified difference pattern covaried significantly with cognitive and motor performance. Our findings indicate that connectivity profiles of functional and structural brain networks act as organizing principles behind age-related cortical thinning as an imaging surrogate of cortical atrophy."	207	NA	207	#NAAM?	400	7	full correlation	individual	yes (negative edges set to 0)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression)    after: other (parcellation scheme)	no			- 400 nodes and 7 networks

In a number of brain disorders, however, metabolic, vascular, and hemodynamic impairments can be expected to alter BOLDFC independently from neuronal activity. By means of a neurovascular coupling (NVC) model of BOLD-FC, we recently demonstrated that aberrant timing of cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses may influence BOLD-FC. In the current work, we support and extend this finding by empirically linking BOLD-FC with capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH), which we consider as an indicator of delayed and broadened CBF responses. We assessed 28 asymptomatic patients with unilateral high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) as a hemodynamic lesion model with largely preserved neurocognitive functioning and 27 age-matched healthy controls. For each participant, we obtained rs-fMRI, arterial spin labeling, and dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI to study the dependence of left-right homotopic BOLD-FC on local perfusion parameters. Additionally, we investigated the dependency of BOLD-FC on CBF response timing by detailed simulations. Homotopic BOLD-FC was negatively associated with increasing CTH differences between homotopic brain areas. This relation was more pronounced in asymptomatic ICAS patients even after controlling for baseline CBF and relative cerebral blood volume influences. These findings match simulation results that predict an influence of delayed and broadened CBF responses on BOLD-FC. Results demonstrate that increasing CTH differences between homotopic brain areas lead to BOLDFC reductions. Simulations suggest that CTH increases correspond to broadened and delayed CBF responses to fluctuations in ongoing neuronal activity.	55	28	27	NA	192	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)  after: age, sex, physiological/biological (baseline CBF and relative CBV), clinical/psychological (hypertension, diabetes)	no			#NAAM?

A longitudinal study of functional connectome uniqueness and its association with psychological distress in adolescence	NEUROIMAGE	Each human brain has a unique functional synchronisation pattern (functional connectome) analogous to a fingerprint that underpins brain functions and related behaviours. Here we examine functional connectome (whole-brain and 13 networks) maturation by measuring its uniqueness in adolescents who underwent brain scans longitudinally from 12 years of age every four months. The uniqueness of a functional connectome is defined as its ratio of self-similarity (from the same subject at a different time point) to the maximal similarity-to-others (from a given subject and any others at a different time point). We found that the unique whole brain connectome exists in 12 years old adolescents, with 92% individuals having a whole brain uniqueness value greater than one. The cingulo-opercular network (CON; a long-acting 'brain control network' configuring information processing) demonstrated marginal uniqueness in early adolescence with 56% of individuals showing uniqueness greater than one (i.e., more similar to her/his own CON four months later than those from any other subjects) and this increased longitudinally. Notably, the low uniqueness of the CON correlates (beta = -18.6, FDR-Q < < 0.001) with K10 levels at the subsequent time point. This association suggests that the individualisation of CON network is related to psychological distress levels. Our findings highlight the potential of longitudinal neuroimaging to capture mental health problems in young people who are undergoing profound neuroplasticity and environment sensitivity period.	63	NA	NA	NA	300	14	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)  after: age, scan related (motion)	no			- 300 ROIs and 14 functional networks  - no mention of edge selection

However, it remains unclear which supramodal cortical regions contribute to this process and what kind of information they represent. Here, we used represen-tational similarity analysis of two large fMRI datasets with a searchlight approach to generate a detailed map of human brain regions where the semantic similarity structure across individual lexical concepts can be reliably detected. We hypothesized that heteromodal cortical areas typically associated with the default mode network encode multimodal experiential informa-tion about concepts, consistent with their proposed role as cortical integration hubs. In two studies involving different sets of concepts and different participants (both sexes), we found a distributed, bihemispheric network engaged in concept represen-tation, composed of high-level association areas in the anterior, lateral, and ventral temporal lobe; inferior parietal lobule; posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus; and medial, dorsal, ventrolateral, and orbital prefrontal cortex. In both studies, a multimodal model combining sensory, motor, affective, and other types of experiential information explained significant var-iance in the neural similarity structure observed in these regions that was not explained by unimodal experiential models or by distributional semantics (i.e., word2vec similarity). These results indicate that during concept retrieval, lexical concepts are represented across a vast expanse of high-level cortical regions, especially in the areas that make up the default mode net-work, and that these regions encode multimodal experiential information.														yes	wrong outcome (task activity)		#NAAM?		no

Ances, Beau and Snyder, Abraham Z. and Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network	Covariance-based vs. correlation-based functional connectivity dissociates healthy aging from Alzheimer disease	NEUROIMAGE	Prior studies of aging and Alzheimer disease have evaluated resting state functional connectivity (FC) using ei-ther seed-based correlation (SBC) or independent component analysis (ICA), with a focus on particular functional systems. SBC and ICA both are insensitive to differences in signal amplitude. At the same time, accumulating ev-idence indicates that the amplitude of spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuations is physiologically meaningful. We systematically compared covariance-based FC, which is sensitive to amplitude, vs. correlation-based FC, which is not, in affected individuals and controls drawn from two cohorts of participants including autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD), late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), and age-matched controls. Functional connec-tivity was computed over 222 regions of interest and group differences were evaluated in terms of components projected onto a space of lower dimension. Our principal observations are: (1) Aging is associated with global loss of resting state fMRI signal amplitude that is approximately uniform across resting state networks. (2) Thus, covariance FC measures decrease with age whereas correlation FC is relatively preserved in healthy aging. (3) In contrast, symptomatic ADAD and LOAD both lead to loss of spontaneous activity amplitude as well as severely degraded correlation structure. These results demonstrate a double dissociation between age vs. Alzheimer dis-ease and the amplitude vs. correlation structure of resting state BOLD signals. Modeling results suggest that the AD-associated loss of correlation structure is attributable to a relative increase in the fraction of locally restricted as opposed to widely shared variance.	232	101	131	- additional DIAN cohort - n = 123 (P) + 83 (HC)	222	NA	multiple	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band pass filtering) after: other (cohort)	no			- association: full correlation, covariance  - no edge selection mentioned - they reduce the dimensionality of FC matrices

Alcohol consumption and MRI markers of brain structure and function: Cohort study of 25,378 UK Biobank participants	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Moderate alcohol consumption is widespread but its impact on brain structure and function is contentious. The relationship between alcohol intake and structural and functional neuroimaging indices, the threshold intake for associations, and whether population subgroups are at higher risk of alcohol-related brain harm remain unclear. 25,378 UK Biobank participants (mean age 54.9 +/- 7.4 years, 12,254 female) underwent multi-modal MRI 9.6 +/- 1.1 years after study baseline. Alcohol use was self-reported at baseline (2006-10). T1-weighted, diffusion weighted and resting state images were examined. Lower total grey matter volumes were observed in those drinking as little as 7-14 units (56-112 g) weekly. Higher alcohol consumption was associated with multiple markers of white matter microstructure, including lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean and radial diffusivity in a spatially distributed pattern across the brain. Associations between functional connectivity and alcohol intake were observed in the default mode, central executive, attention, salience and visual resting state networks. Relationships between total grey matter and alcohol were stronger than other modifiable factors, including blood pressure and smoking, and robust to unobserved confounding. Frequent binging, higher blood pressure and BMI steepened the negative association between alcohol and total grey matter volume. In this large observational cohort study, alcohol consumption was associated with multiple structural and functional MRI markers in mid-to late-life.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- group ICA  - unclear what they are doing: ""Resting state fMRI was used to determinelarge-scale brain functional connectivity.

This study aims to identify functional connectome that encodes individual variations of pandemic-related vicarious traumatization and reveal the underlying brain-vicarious traumatization mechanism in predicting general distress. The eligible subjects were 105 general university students (60 females, aged from 19 to 27 years) undergoing brain MRI scanning and baseline behavioral tests (October 2019 to January 2020), whom were re-contacted for COVID-related vicarious traumatization measurement (February to April 2020) and follow-up general distress evaluation (March to April 2021). We applied a connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) approach to identify the functional connectome supporting vicarious traumatization based on a 268-region-parcellation assigned to network memberships. The CPM analyses showed that only the negative network model stably predicted individuals' vicarious traumatization scores (q 2 =-0.18, MSE = 617, r [predicted, actual] = 0.18, p = 0.024), with the contributing functional connectivity primarily distributed in the fronto-parietal, default mode, medial frontal, salience, and motor network. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that vicarious traumatization mediated the influence of brain functional connectome on general distress. Importantly, our results were independent of baseline family socioeconomic status, other stressful life events and general mental health as well as age, sex and head motion. Our study is the first to provide evidence for the functional neural markers of vicarious traumatization and reveal an underlying neuropsychological pathway to predict distress symptoms in which brain functional connectome affects general distress via vicarious traumatization.	105	NA	105	NA	225	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering) after: age, sex, scan related (motion), clinical/psychological (general mental health, stressful life events), other (family SES)	no			- 3 parcellations used: 268, 160, 246, averaged for network size  - no mention of edge selection

The neurobiological basis of SCA3 is still poorly understood, and up until now resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has not been used to study this disease. In the current study we investigated (multi-echo) rs-fMRI data from patients with genetically confirmed SCA3 (n = 17) and matched healthy subjects (n = 16). Using independent component analysis (ICA) and subsequent regression with bootstrap resampling, we identified a pattern of differences between patients and healthy subjects, which we coined the fMRI SCA3 related pattern (fSCA3-RP) comprising cerebellum, anterior striatum and various cortical regions. Individual fSCA3-RP scores were highly correlated with a previously published F-18-FDG PET pattern found in the same sample (rho = 0.78, P = 0.0003). Also, a high correlation was found with the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia scores (r = 0.63, P = 0.007). No correlations were found with neuropsychological test scores, nor with levels of grey matter atrophy. Compared with the F-18-FDG PET pattern, the fSCA3-RP included a more extensive contribution of the mediofrontal cortex, putatively representing changes in default network activity. This rs-fMRI identification of additional regions is proposed to reflect a consequence of the nature of the BOLD technique, enabling measurement of dynamic network activity, compared to the more static F-18-FDG PET methodology. Altogether, our findings shed new light on the neural substrate of SCA3, and encourage further validation of the fSCA3-RP to assess its potential contribution as imaging biomarker for future research and clinical use.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- use group ICA to construct networks between voxels for each individual  - no mention of edge selection and association type (seems to be just variance?) - "" Prior to further analyses, individual ICs (maps, time courses and power spectra) were inspected independently by two raters (H.J.v.d.H. and S.K.M.) and discussed until consensus was reached regarding the neural or artefactual nature of components.

Baseline Functional Connectivity in Resting State Networks Associated with Depression and Remission Status after 16 Weeks of Pharmacotherapy: A CAN-BIND Report	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Understanding the neural underpinnings of major depressive disorder (MDD) and its treatment could improve treatment outcomes. So far, findings are variable and large sample replications scarce. We aimed to replicate and extend altered functional connectivity associated with MDD and pharmacotherapy outcomes in a large, multisite sample. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 129 patients and 99 controls through the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression. Symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Connectivity was measured as correlations between four seeds (anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and all other brain voxels. Partial least squares was used to compare connectivity prior to treatment between patients and controls, and between patients reaching remission (MADRS <= 10) early (within 8 weeks), late (within 16 weeks), or not at all. We replicated previous findings of altered connectivity in patients. In addition, baseline connectivity of the anterior/posterior cingulate and insula seeds differentiated patients with different treatment outcomes. The stability of these differences was established in the largest single-site subsample. Our replication and extension of altered connectivity highlighted previously reported and new differences between patients and controls, and revealed features that might predict remission prior to pharmacotherapy.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based

Individual differences in amygdala volumes predict changes in functional connectivity between subcortical and cognitive control networks throughout adolescence	NEUROIMAGE	Adolescence is a critical period of structural and functional neural maturation among regions serving the cognitive control of emotion. Evidence suggests that this process is guided by developmental changes in amygdala and striatum structure and shifts in functional connectivity between subcortical (SC) and cognitive control (CC) networks. Herein, we investigate the extent to which such developmental shifts in structure and function reciprocally predict one another over time. 179 youth (9-15 years-old) completed annual MRI scans for three years. Amygdala and striatum volumes and connectivity within and between SC and CC resting state networks were measured for each year. We tested for reciprocal predictability of within-person and between-person changes in structure and function using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models. Within-person shifts in amygdala volumes in a given year significantly and specifically predicted deviations in SC-CC connectivity in the following year, such that an increase in volume was associated with decreased SC-CC connectivity the following year. Deviations in connectivity did not predict changes in amygdala volumes over time. Conversely, broader group-level shifts in SC-CC connectivity were predictive of subsequent deviations in striatal volumes. We did not see any cross-predictability among amygdala or striatum volumes and within-network connectivity measures. Within-person shifts in amygdala structure year-to-year robustly predicted weaker SC-CC connectivity in subsequent years, whereas broader increases in SC-CC connectivity predicted smaller striatal volumes over time. These specific structure function relationships may contribute to the development of emotional control across adolescence.	179	NA	179	NA	7	NA	full correlation	aggregated	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA noise removal) after: age, sex, other (site)	no			"- unclear paper - nodes: ""Group independent component analysis (ICA; Calhoun et al., 2001; Calhoun and Adali, 2012) of the preprocessed functional data yielded 150 spatially-independent components, 51 of which were identified as components comprising seven different resting state networks.

Here, we sought to boost the reactivation of a motor memory trace during postlearning wakefulness (quiet rest) immediately following learning using somatosensory targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural correlates of the reactivation process as well as the effect of the TMR intervention on brain responses elicited by task practice on 24 healthy young adults. Behavioral data of the post-TMR retest session showed a faster learning rate for the motor sequence that was reactivated as compared to the not-reactivated sequence. Brain imaging data revealed that motor, parietal, frontal, and cerebellar brain regions, which were recruited during initial motor learning, were specifically reactivated during the TMR episode and that hippocampo-frontal connectivity was modulated by the reactivation process. Importantly, the TMR-induced behavioral advantage was paralleled by dynamical changes in hippocampal activity and hippocampo-motor connectivity during task practice. Altogether, the present results suggest that somatosensory TMR during postlearning quiet rest can enhance motor performance via the modulation of hippocampo-cortical responses.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- ppi, unclear 		PPI

However, differences in wholebrain functional connectivity (i.e., functional connectomes) due to handedness have been relatively understudied beyond pre-specified networks of interest. Here, we compared functional connectomes of left- and right-handed individuals at the whole brain level. We explored differences in functional connectivity of previously established regions of interest, and showed differences between primarily left- and primarily right-handed individuals in the motor, somatosensory, and language areas using functional connectivity. We then proceeded to investigate these differences in the whole brain and found that the functional connectivity of left- and right-handed individuals are not specific to networks of interest, but extend across every region of the brain. In particular, we found that connections between and within the cerebellum show distinct patterns of connectivity. To put these effects into context, we show that the effect sizes associated with handedness differences account for a similar amount of individual differences in the connectome as sex differences. Together these results shed light on regions of the brain beyond those traditionally explored that contribute to differences in the functional organization of left- and right-handed individuals and underscore that handedness effects are neurobiologically meaningful in addition to being statistically significant.	817	669	148	NA	268	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (edges involving nodes of interest)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (nuisance covariate regression) after: age, sex, clinical/psychological (clinical diagnoses), other (site)	no			"- edge selection: ""Connectomes were partitioned into matrices that only contained edges that stem from a node of interest or edges between nodes of interest."" - edges were only thresholded for visualisation "	Zarah: edge inclusion strategy = edges involving nodes of interest

The hypothalamus is a central component of the brain networks that regulate food intake. Animal research parsed the roles of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and medial hypothalamus (MH) in hunger and satiety, respectively. Here, we examined how hunger and satiety change information flow between human LH and MH brain networks, and how these interactions are influenced by body mass index (BMI). Forty participants (16 overweight/obese) underwent two resting-state functional MRI scans while being fasted and sated. The excitatory/inhibitory influence of information flow between the MH and LH was modelled using spectral dynamic causal modelling. Our results revealed two core networks interacting across homeostatic state and weight: subcortical bidirectional connections between the LH, MH and the substantia nigra pars compacta (prSN), and cortical top-down inhibition from fronto-parietal and temporal areas. During fasting, we found higher inhibition between the LH and prSN, whereas the prSN received greater top-down inhibition from across the cortex. Individuals with higher BMI showed that these network dynamics occur irrespective of homeostatic state. Our findings reveal fasting affects brain dynamics over a distributed hypothalamic-midbrain-cortical network. This network is less sensitive to state-related fluctuations among people with obesity. Author Summary The hypothalamus is a central component of the brain networks regulating food intake. Animal research subdivided the hypothalamus anatomically and functionally into lateral hypothalamus (LH) and medial hypothalamus (MH). This is the first study showing how the LH and MH causally interact with other neural regions and how their dynamics change with weight and homeostasis in humans. Adopting state-of-the-art spectral dynamic causal modelling of resting-state fMRI data, we provide new insights into how homeostasis affect hypothalamic circuit dynamics, which involve a distributed network of midbrain and cortical areas with a key role of the substantia nigra. We identified unique aspects of network organisation associated with obesity involving reciprocal connections between the LH and MH, and input from the substantia nigra to the MH.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- selection: ""Brain voxels with a threshold of p < 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons on the voxel-level were considered significant."""			this is ICA - I think we excluded this?

Yet our ability to estimate cognitive abilities via brain MRI is still poor in both prediction and reliability. Our study tested if this inability can be improved by integrating MRI signals across the whole brain and across modalities, including task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) of different tasks along with other non-task MRI modalities, such as structural MRI, resting-state functional connectivity. Using the Human Connectome Project ( n = 873, 473 females, after quality control), we directly compared predictive models comprising different sets of MRI modalities (e.g., seven tasks vs. non-task modalities). We applied two approaches to integrate multimodal MRI, stacked vs. flat models, and implemented 16 combinations of machine-learning algorithms. The stacked model integrating all modalities via stacking Elastic Net provided the best prediction ( r = 0.57), relatively to other models tested, as well as excellent test-retest reliability (ICC =similar to.85) in capturing general cognitive abilities. Importantly, compared to the stacked model integrating across non-task modalities ( r = 0.27), the stacked model integrating tfMRI across tasks led to significantly higher prediction ( r = 0.56) while still providing excellent test-retest reliability (ICC=similar to.83). The stacked model integrating tfMRI across tasks was driven by frontal and parietal areas and by tasks that are cognition-related (working-memory, relational processing, and language). This result is consistent with the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence. Accordingly, our results contradict the recently popular notion that tfMRI is not reliable enough to capture individual differences in cognition. Instead, our study suggests that tfMRI, when used appropriately (i.e., by drawing information across the whole brain and across tasks and by inte-grating with other modalities), provides predictive and reliable sources of information for individual differences in cognitive abilities, more so than non-task modalities.	873	NA	873	#NAAM?	379	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-FIX nuisance covariate regression)    after: age, sex, scan related (motion), other (race/ethnicity)	no			#NAAM?

In this model, we employed a generator to produce spatiotemporal reconstructions and employed two separate discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators) for the assessment. We trained and tested the f-CVGAN on two publicly available video-fMRI datasets, and the model produced pixel-level reconstructions of 8 perceived video frames from each fMRI volume. Experimental results showed that the reconstructed videos were fMRI-related and captured important spatial and temporal information of the original stimuli. Moreover, we visualized the cortical importance map and found that the visual cortex is extensively involved in the reconstruction, whereas the low-level visual areas (V1/V2/V3/V4) showed the largest contribution. Our work suggests that slow blood oxygen level-dependent signals describe neural representations of the fast perceptual process that can be decoded in practice.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Most of rTMS studies on PD used high-frequency stimulation; however, excessive nonvoluntary movement may represent abnormally cortical excitability, which is likely to be suppressed by low-frequency rTMS. Decreased neural activity in the basal ganglia on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a characteristic of PD. In the present study, we found that low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS targeting individual finger-tapping activation elevated the amplitude of local neural activity (percentage amplitude fluctuation, PerAF) in the putamen as well as the functional connectivity (FC) of the stimulation target and basal ganglia in healthy participants. These results provide evidence for our hypothesis that low-frequency rTMS over the individual task activation site can modulate deep brain functions, and that FC might serve as a bridge transmitting the impact of rTMS to the deep brain regions. It suggested that a precisely localized individual task activation site can act as a target for low-frequency rTMS when it is used as a therapeutic tool for PD.														yes	wrong outcome (acquisition)		#NAAM?

The dorsal raphe (DR) and median raphe (MR) nuclei are the main source of 5-HT neurons, however, brain connectivity changes in these two nuclei have not been delineated in PD. Here we used resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to characterize functional connectivity profiles of DR and MR and further examine the associations between dysconnectivity of raphe nuclei and clinical phenotypes of PD. We found that DR and MR commonly hypo-connected with the sensorimotor, temporal, and occipital cortex, limbic system, left thalamus, putamen, and cerebellum in PD. DR had unique decreased connectivity with the bilateral prefrontal and cingulate cortices, while MR had lower connectivity with the pons. Moreover, reduced connectivity of DR correlated with depression, drowsiness, and anxiety, whereas dysconnectivity of MR correlated with depression, cognitive deficits, sleep disturbances, and pain. Our findings highlight the complex roles of raphe nuclei in motor and nonmotor symptoms, providing novel insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of PD.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

However, the impact of these pathological changes on large-scale dynamic integration and segregation of the cortex are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of subcortical dysfunction on cortical dynamics and cognition in PD. Spatiotemporal dynamics of the phase interactions of resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals in 159 PD patients and 152 normal control (NC) individuals were estimated. The relationships between subcortical atrophy, subcortical-cortical fiber connectivity impairment, cortical synchronization/metastability, and cognitive performance were then assessed. We found that cortical synchronization and metastability in PD patients were significantly decreased. To examine whether this is an effect of dopamine depletion, we investigated 45 PD patients both ON and OFF dopamine replacement therapy, and found that cortical synchronization and metastability are significantly increased in the ON state. The extent of cortical synchronization and metastability in the OFF state reflected cognitive performance and mediates the difference in cognitive performance between the PD and NC groups. Furthermore, both the thalamic volume and thalamocortical fiber connectivity had positive relationships with cortical synchronization and metastability in the dopaminergic OFF state, and mediate the difference in cortical synchronization between the PD and NC groups. In addition, thalamic volume also reflected cognitive performance, and cortical synchronization/metastability mediated the relationship between thalamic volume and cognitive performance in PD patients. Together, these results highlight that subcortical dysfunction and reduced dopamine levels are responsible for decreased cortical synchronization and metastability, further affecting cognitive performance in PD. This might lead to biomarkers being identified that can predict if a patient is at risk of developing dementia.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

The experiment contains 2 conditions: the dyad collaborated to win and then split the reward in the cooperation condition, whereas the winner took all the reward in the competition condition, thereby resulting in dynamic strategic interactions. To calculate the cerebral coherence in such jittered event-related fMRI tasks, we first iteratively estimated the feedback-related blood oxygenation level-dependent responses of each trial, using 8 finite impulse response functions (16 s) and then concatenated the beta volume series. With the right temporal-parietal junction (rTPJ) as the seed, the interpersonal connected brain areas were separately identified: the right superior temporal gyrus (rSTG) (cooperation) and the left precuneus (lPrecuneus) (competition), both peaking at the designated frequency bin (1/16 s = 0.0625 Hz), but not in permuted pairs. In addition, the extended coherence analyses on shorter and longer concatenated volumes verified that only in the optimal trial frequency did the rTPJ-rSTG and rTPJ-lPrecuneus couplings peak. In sum, our approach both showcases a flexible analysis method that widens the applicability of interpersonal coherence in the rapid event-related fMRI hyperscanning and reveals a context-based inter-brain coupling between interacting pairs during cooperation and during competition.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		seed-based			
Wen, HJ and Xu, T and Wang, XY and Yu, X and Bi, YC and Wen, Haojie and Xu, Ting and Wang, Xiaoying and Yu, Xi and Bi, Yanchao	Brain intrinsic connection patterns underlying tool processing in human adults are present in neonates and not in macaques	NEUROIMAGE	Tool understanding and use are supported by a dedicated left-lateralized, intrinsically connected network in the human adult brain. To examine this network's phylogenetic and ontogenetic origins, we compared resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) among regions subserving tool processing in human adults to rsFC among homologous regions in human neonates and macaque monkeys (adolescent and mature). These homologous regions formed an intrinsic network in human neonates, but not in macaques. Network topological patterns were highly similar between human adults and neonates, and significantly less so between humans and macaques. The premotor-parietal rsFC had most significant contribution to the formation of the neonatal tool network. These results suggest that an intrinsic brain network potentially supporting tool processing exists in the human brain prior to individual tool use experiences, and that the premotor-parietal functional connection in particular offers a brain basis for complex tool behaviors specific to humans.	106	NA	NA	- additional samples: 100 adults, macaque monkeys (not focused on here)	5	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band pass filtering)   after: scan related (temporal SNR), other (sample size, inter-nodal Euclidean distance, ROI selection) 	no			"- no mention of edge selection - included samples of adults, neonates, and macaque monkeys - nodes based on ""For the two clusters in the ventral visual pathways, more stringent thresholds were applied to identify functionally distinctive ROIs, resulting in right fusiform face area (RFFA), right occipital face area (ROFA) and right superior temporal gyrus (RSTG) on the right (z= 5 for RSTG; z = 11 for ROFA and RFFA) and left fusiform face area (LFFA) and left occipital face area (LOFA) on the left (z= 8)."""					
Zhu, JW and Qiu, AQ and Zhu, Jingwen and Qiu, Anqi	Interindividual variability in functional connectivity discovers differential development of cognition and transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology in youth	NEUROIMAGE	Cognitive and psychological development during adolescence is different from one another, which is rooted in in-dividual differences in maturational changes in the adolescent brain. This study employed multi-modal MRI data and characterized interindividual variability in functional connectivity (IVFC) and its associations with cogni-tion and psychopathology using the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 755 youth. We employed resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion weighted images (DWIs) to estimate brain structural and func-tional networks. We computed the IVFC of individuals and examined its relation with structural and functional organizations. We further employed sparse partial least squares (sparse-PLS) and meta-analysis to examine the de-velopmental associations of the IVFC with cognition and transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology in early, middle, and late adolescence. Our results revealed that the IVFC spatial topography reflects the brain functional integration and structure-function decoupling. Age effects on the IVFC of association networks were mediated by the FC among the triple networks, including frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks (DMN), while those of primary and cerebellar networks were mediated by the cerebello-cortical FC. The IVFC of the triple and cerebellar networks explained the variance of executive functions and externalizing behaviors in early adoles-cence and then the variance of emotion and internalizing and psychosis in middle and late adolescence. We further evaluated this finding via meta-analysis on task-based studies on cognition and psychopathology. These findings implicate the emerging importance of the IVFC of the triple and cerebellar networks in cognitive, emotional, and psychopathological development during adolescence.	717	NA	717	NA	268	14	not specified	individual	yes (regularisation)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering)  after: sex, scan related (motion), other (race)	no			- inclusion strategy: GLASSO regularisation - 268 parcels and 14 networks	GLASSO is a regularisation method (https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/9/3/432/224260), so it should be reported under edge inclusion strategies.

Altered brain network topology in children with auditory processing disorder: A resting-state multi-echo fMRI study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Children with auditory processing disorder (APD) experience hearing difficulties, particularly in the presence of competing sounds, despite having normal audiograms. There is considerable debate on whether APD symptoms originate from bottom-up (e.g., auditory sensory processing) and/or top-down processing (e.g., cognitive, language, memory). A related issue is that little is known about whether functional brain network topology is altered in APD. Therefore, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to investigate the functional brain network organization of 57 children from 8 to 14 years old, diagnosed with APD (n = 28) and without hearing difficulties (healthy control, HC; n = 29). We applied complex network analysis using graph theory to assess the whole-brain integration and segregation of functional networks and brain hub architecture. Our results showed children with APD and HC have similar global network properties -i.e., an average of all brain regions- and modular organization. Still, the APD group showed different hub architecture in default mode-ventral attention, somatomotor and frontoparietal-dorsal attention modules. At the nodal level -i.e., single-brain regions-, we observed decreased participation coefficient (PC - a measure quantifying the diversity of between-network connectivity) in auditory cortical regions in APD, including bilateral superior temporal gyms and left middle temporal gyms. Beyond auditory regions, PC was also decreased in APD in bilateral posterior temporo-occipital cortices, left intraparietal sulcus, and right posterior insular cortex. Correlation analysis suggested a positive association between PC in the left parahippocampal gyrus and the listening-in-spatialized-noise -sentences task where APD children were engaged in auditory perception. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence of altered brain network organization in children with APD, specific to auditory networks, and shed new light on the neural systems underlying children's listening difficulties.	57	28	29	NA	333	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA-AROMA denoising, global signal regression, band-pass filtering) after: age, clinical/psychological (patient group)	no

Indeed, disruptions in large-scale structural and functional brain networks have been associated with psychotic symptoms. However, brain activity is largely constrained by underlying white matter pathways and the study of function-structure dependency, compared to conventional unimodal analysis, allows a biologically relevant assessment of neural mechanisms. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) constitutes a remarkable opportunity to study the pathophysiological processes of psychosis. Methods: 58 healthy controls and 57 deletion carriers, aged from 16 to 32 years old, underwent resting-state functional and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Deletion carriers were additionally fully assessed for psychotic symptoms. Firstly, we used a graph signal processing method to combine brain activity and structural connectivity measures to obtain regional structural decoupling indexes (SDIs). We use SDI to assess the differences of functional structural dependency (FSD) across the groups. Subsequently we investigated how alterations in FSDs are associated with the severity of positive psychotic symptoms in participants with 22q11DS. Results: In line with previous findings, participants in both groups showed a spatial gradient of FSD ranging from sensory-motor regions (stronger FSD) to regions involved in higher-order function (weaker FSD). Compared to controls, in participants with 22q11DS, and further in deletion carriers with more severe positive psychotic symptoms, the functional activity was more strongly dependent on the structure in parahippocampal gyrus and subcortical dopaminergic regions, while it was less dependent within the cingulate cortex. This analysis revealed group differences not otherwise detected when assessing the structural and functional nodal measures separately. Conclusions: Our findings point toward a disrupted modulation of functional activity on the underlying structure, which was further associated to psychopathology for candidate critical regions in 22q11DS. This study provides the first evidence for the clinical relevance of function-structure dependency and its contribution to the emergence of psychosis.	115	57	58	NA	246	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)  after: age, scan related (motion)	no			#NAAM?

The principal cause of iron deficiency is undernutrition in low-income countries and malnutrition in middle to upper income regions. Iron is a key element for myelin production, neuronal metabolism, and dopamine functions. Iron deficiency in early life can alter brain development and exert long-lasting effects. Control inhibition is an executive function that involves several brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and caudate and subthalamic nuclei. Dopamine is the prevalent neurotransmitter underlying cognitive inhibition. We followed cohort study participants who had iron deficiency anemia in infancy as well non-anemic controls. At 22 years of age, the participants were subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate the correlation between functional connectivity and performance on an inhibitory cognitive task (Go/No-Go). We hypothesized that former iron deficient anemic (FIDA) participants demonstrate less strength in functional connectivity compared with controls (C). There were not significant group differences in the behavioral results in terms of accuracy and response time. A continuous covariate interaction analysis of functional connectivity and the Go/ No-Go scores demonstrated significant differences between the FIDA and C groups. The FIDA participants demonstrated less strength in connectivity in brain regions related to control inhibition, including the medial temporal lobe, impairment in the integration of the default mode network (indicating decreased attention and alertness), and an increase in connectivity in posterior brain areas, all of which suggest slower circuitry maturation. The results support the hypothesis that FIDA young adults show differences in the connectivity of networks related to executive functions. These differences could increase their vulnerability to develop cognitive dysfunctions or mental disorders in adulthood.	85	NA	NA	NA	5	NA	not specified	aggregated	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: sex (sample matching), clinical/psychological (depressive symptoms (sample matching)), other (maternal age, education, SES, absence of father (all sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)  after: age, sex	no			- no mention of edge selection or association type, no explicit mention of nodes

Nevertheless, a large proportion of patients with IS regain swallowing function within 6 months; however, the neural mechanism for this recovery remains unclear. We aimed to investigate possible neuroplastic changes involved using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and their relation to swallowing function. We assessed 21 patients with IS (mean age: 59.9 +/- 11.1 years) exhibiting dysphagia in the subacute phase and 21 healthy controls (mean age: 57.1 +/- 7.8 years). Patient evaluations were based on the functional oral intake scale (FOIS), videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS), and fMRI. Temporal swallowing measures and the penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) were obtained using VFSS. Whole-brain-medulla restingstate functional connectivity (rsFC) was calculated and compared between patients and healthy controls. The rsFCs were also correlated with functional measures within the patient group. In patients with IS, wholebrain-medulla rsFCs were significantly higher in the precuneus, the left and right precentral gyrus, and the right supplementary motor area compared to those in healthy controls (P < 0.001, family-wise error-corrected clusterlevel P < 0.05). The rsFCs to the medulla for the left (r = -0.507, P = 0.027) and right side (r = -0.503, P = 0.028) precentral gyrus were negatively correlated with the PAS. The rsFC between the left (r = 0.470, P = 0.042) and right (r = 0.459, P = 0.048) precentral gyrus to the medulla was positively correlated with upper esophageal sphincter opening durations (UOD). In addition, PAS was also correlated with UOD (r = -0.638, P = 0.003) whereas the laryngeal closure duration was correlated with the hyoid bone movement duration (r = 0.550, P = 0.015). Patients with IS exhibited overall modulation of cortical-medulla connectivity during the subacute phase. Patients with higher connectivities showed better swallowing performance. These findings support that there is cortical involvement in swallowing regulation after IS and can aid in determining potential treatment targets for dysphagia.	42	21	21	NA	4	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), scan related (motion) after: age, sex 	no			"- no mention of modelliing or edge selection - all information about rsFC here: ""Whole-brain rsFC analysis (Jia et al., 2019) was performed using RESTplus after data were preprocessedas described above.

We combined lesion network mapping and task-based functional MRI in 71 patients with post-stroke aphasia to investigate, whether diaschisis and its resolution contribute to early loss and recovery of language functions. Language activation acquired in the acute, subacute and chronic phase was analyzed in compartments with high and low normative resting-state functional connectivity to the lesion site on an individual basis. Regions with high compared to regions with low lesion connectivity showed a steeper increase in language reactivation from the acute to the subacute phase. This finding is compatible with the assumption of resolution of diaschisis. Additionally, language performance in the subacute phase and improvement from the subacute to the chronic phase significantly correlated with the diaschisis effect and its resolution, respectively, suggesting a behavioral relevance of this effect. We therefore assume that undamaged but functionally connected regions become dysfunctional due to missing input from the lesion contributing to the aphasic deficit. Since these regions are structurally intact, dysfunction resolves over time contributing to the rapid early behavioral improvement observed in aphasic stroke patients. Our results demonstrate that diaschisis and its resolution might be a relevant mechanism of early loss and recovery of language function in acute stroke patients.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- rsFC network is built from ""normative cohort"" - no mention of edge selection - not much information on network size, mainly: ""The mask was then divided into two regions for every patient: one region representing the quartile with the highest and another region representing the quartile with the lowest normative lesion connectivity."""

Trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are factors known to impact healthy aging and have been reported to be associated with functional connectivity differences. In the present study, we examined and compared differences in withindefault mode network (DMN), within-salience network (SN) and between-DMN-SN functional connectivity, between trauma-exposed individuals with and without PTSD symptoms as well as non-traumatized individuals in a non-clininical older adult sample. METHODS: Resting state functional MRI and behavioral data is taken from the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain Database Project (LHAB). For the present analysis, participants who completed the questionnaires on trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (N = 110 individuals of which n = 50 individuals reported previous trauma exposure and n = 25 individuals reported PTSD symptoms; mean age = 70.55 years, SD = 4.82) were included. RESULTS: The reporting of PTSD symptoms relative to no symptoms was associated with lower within-DMN connectivity, while on a trend level trauma-exposed individuals showed higher within-SN connectivity compared to non-trauma exposed individuals. Consistent with existing models of healthy aging, between-DMN-SN functional connectivity showed an increase across time in older age. CONCLUSION: Present results suggest that alterations in within-DMN and within-SN functional connectivity also occur in non-treatment seeking older adult populations with trauma exposure and in association with PTSD symptoms. These changes manifest, alongside altered between-DMN-SN functional connectivity, in older age supposedly independent of aging-related functional desegregation.	110	50	60	#NAAM?	100	7	correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering)  after: age, gender, other (education)	no			- 100 ROIs and 7 networks of interest - pairwise correlation - no mention of edge selection

Only few studies exist on underlying changes of functional connectivity (FC). Methods: 20 patients with unilateral high-grade ICA stenosis without MRI lesions and 25 aged-match controls underwent resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and neuropsychological assessment. Patients were examined within ten days before and 6-10 weeks after surgical or interventional revascularization of carotid stenosis. We examined mean resting-state FC ipsi-and contralateral to stenosis and network topology using graph-theoretical measures. Results: At baseline, intrahemispheric FC was similar for patients and healthy controls. After revascularization mean FC increased moderately without an effect on network topology. Patients performed worse in TMT B and Stroop test, while performance in global screening tests for dementia (Mini Mental Status Examination, DemTect) were comparable. Test results did not improve after revascularization. Conclusion: In our study population, we find no effect of chronic hypoperfusion on FC and global cognitive function, although we observe minor impairments in processing speed and mental flexibility. The subtle increase of FC after revascularization could indicate excessive upregulation after restoration of perfusion. However, it might as well be a coincidental finding due to the limited sample size.	45	20	25	NA	80	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes (absolutised)	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering, global signal regression)  after: age, sex 	no

Functional connectivity (FC) within and between the default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN) and salience network (SN) has been shown to be altered post-concussion. Few studies have investigated connectivity within and between these 3 networks following a pediatric concussion. The present study explored whether within and between-network FC differs between a pediatric concussion and orthopedic injury (OI) group aged 10-18. Participants underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scan at 4 weeks post-injury. One-way ANCOVA analyses were conducted between groups with the seed-based FC of the 3 networks. A total of 55 concussion and 27 OI participants were included in the analyses. Increased within -network FC of the CEN and decreased between-network FC of the DMN-CEN was found in the concussion group when compared to the OI group. Secondary analyses using spherical SN regions of interest revealed increased within-network FC of the SN and increased between-network FC of the DMN-SN and CEN-SN in the concussion group when compared to the OI group. This study identified differential connectivity patterns following a pediatric concussion as compared to an OI 4 weeks post-injury. These differences indicate potential adaptive brain mechanisms that may provide insight into recovery trajectories and appropriate timing of treatment within the first month following a concussion.	82	82	NA	- patients divided into concussion (55) and orthopaedic injury (27) groups	12	3	full correlation	individual	both used and not used	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression to remove cardiac/respiration artifacts, band-pass filtering, global signal regression)  after: age, sex, clinical/psychological (composite diagnostic score), other (handedness, randomisation group)	no			- unclear number of nodes, seems to be 12 nodes in 3 networks   - thresholding only in between group comparisons

The underlying neural substrate of the hypothalamic involvement (HI)-related cognitive decline in patients with ACP is still unclear. We aimed to combine the multi-modal neuroimaging and histological characteristics of the ACP to explore the potential neural substrate of the HI-related cognitive decline. 45 patients with primary ACPs (invasive, 23; noninvasive, 22) and 52 healthy control subjects (HCs) were admitted to the cross-sectional study. No significant difference in cognitive domains was observed between HCs and patients with noninvasive ACPs (NACP). Patients with invasive ACPs (IACP) showed significantly lower working memory performance (WM, p = 0.002) than patients with NACP. The WM decline was correlated with the disruption of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem in the default mode network (DMN) (r = 0.45, p = 0.004). The increased radial diffusivity of the fornix, indicating demyelinating process, was correlated with the disruption of the MTL subsystem (r =-0.48, p = 0.002). Our study demonstrated that the fornix alterations link DMN disruption to HI-related cognitive decline in patients with ACPs. ACPs that invade the hypothalamus can provide a natural disease model to investigate the potential neural substrate of HI-related cognitive decline.	97	45	52	NA	11	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), other (education (sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regressino to remove cardiac/respiration artifacts, band-pass filtering, global signal regression) after: age, sex, physiological/biological (intracranial volume)	no			"- mention that ""For each subject, we first calculated a Pearson’s correlation and the significance level (i.e., p-value) between all given ROIs."" but do not say whether this significance level was used to exclude edges from analysis "

Acupuncture has emerged as a promising method for treating MWoA. However, the brain mech-anism underlying acupuncture is yet unclear. The present study aimed to examine the effects of acupuncture in regulating brain connectivity of the key regions in pain modulation. In this study, MWoA patients were recruited and randomly assigned to 4 weeks of real or sham acupuncture. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected before and after the treatment. A modern neuroimaging literature meta- analysis of 515 fMRI studies was conducted to identify pain modulation-related key regions as regions of interest (ROIs). Seed-to-voxel resting state-functional connectivity (rsFC) method and repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance were conducted to determine the interaction effects between the two groups and time (baseline and post-treatment). The changes in rsFC were evaluated between baseline and post-treatment in real and sham acupuncture groups, respectively. Clinical data at baseline and post-treatment were also recorded in order to determine between-group differences in clinical outcomes as well as correlations between rsFC changes and clinical effects. 40 subjects were involved in the final analysis. The current study demonstrated significant improvement in real acupuncture vs sham acupuncture on headache severity (monthly migraine days), headache impact (6-item Headache Impact Test), and health-related quality of life (Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire). Five pain modulation-related key regions, including the right amygdala (AMYG), left insula (INS), left medial orbital superior frontal gyrus (PFCventmed), left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and right middle cingulate cortex (MCC), were selected based on the meta-analysis on brain imaging studies. This study found that 1) after acupuncture treatment, migraine patients of the real acupuncture group showed significantly enhanced connectivity in the right AMYG/MCC-left MTG and the right MCC-right superior temporal gyrus (STG) compared to that of the sham acupuncture group; 2) negative correlations were established between clinical effects and increased rsFC in the right AMYG/MCC-left MTG; 3) baseline right AMYG-left MTG rsFC predicts monthly migraine days reduction after treatment. The current results suggested that acupuncture may concur-rently regulate the rsFC of two pain modulation regions in the AMYG and MCC. MTG and STG may be the key nodes linked to multisensory processing of pain modulation in migraine with acupuncture treatment. These findings highlighted the potential of acupuncture for migraine management and the mechanisms underlying the modulation effects.	40	40	NA	NA	5	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering) after: age, sex, other (education)	no			#NAAM?					
Williams, KA and Numssen, O and Hartwigsen, G and Williams, Kathleen A. and Numssen, Ole and Hartwigsen, Gesa	Task-Specific Network Interactions across Key Cognitive Domains	CEREBRAL CORTEX	Human cognition is organized in distributed networks in the brain. Although distinct specialized networks have been identified for different cognitive functions, previous work also emphasizes the overlap of key cognitive domains in higher level association areas. The majority of previous studies focused on network overlap and dissociation during resting states whereas task-related network interactions across cognitive domains remain largely unexplored. A better understanding of network overlap and dissociation during different cognitive tasks may elucidate flexible (re-)distribution of resources during human cognition. The present study addresses this issue by providing a broad characterization of large-scale network dynamics in three key cognitive domains. Combining prototypical tasks of the larger domains of attention, language, and social cognition with whole-brain multivariate activity and connectivity approaches, we provide a spatiotemporal characterization of multiple large-scale, overlapping networks that differentially interact across cognitive domains. We show that network activity and interactions increase with increased cognitive complexity across domains. Interaction patterns reveal a common core structure across domains as well as dissociable domain-specific network activity. The observed patterns of activation and deactivation of overlapping and strongly coupled networks provide insight beyond region-specific activity within a particular cognitive domain toward a network perspective approach across diverse key cognitive functions.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- ppi - weights: ""Additionally, the template battery included binary masks of each network from the 17-network parcellation..."" but then figure 5 implies weights by presenting r from -.5 to .5"		PPI

The aim of the current study is to characterize the cortical hub regions related to the recovery of consciousness. In the current fMRI study, voxel-wise degree centrality analysis was adopted to identify the cortical hubs related to the recovery of consciousness, for which a total of 27 UWS patients were recruited, including 13 patients who emerged from UWS (UWS-E), and 14 patients who remained in UWS (UWS-R) at least three months after the experiment performance. Furthermore, other recoverable unconscious states were adopted as validation groups, including three independent N3 sleep datasets (n = 12, 9, 9 respectively) and three independent anesthesia datasets (n = 27, 14, 6 respectively). Spatial similarity of the hub characteristic with the validation groups between the UWS-E and UWS-R was compared using the dice coefficient. Finally, with the cortical regions persistently shown as hubs across UWS-E and validation states, functional connectivity analysis was further performed to explore the connectivity patterns underlying the recovery of consciousness. The results identified four cortical hubs in the UWS-E, which showed significantly higher degree centrality for UWS-E than UWS-R, including the anterior precuneus, left inferior parietal lobule, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus, of which the degree centrality value also positively correlated with the patients' Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score that assessed global brain functioning outcome after a brain injury. Furthermore, the anterior precuneus was found with significantly higher similarity of hub characteristics as well as functional connectivity patterns between UWS-E and the validation groups. The results suggest that the recovery of consciousness may be relevant to the integrity of cortical hubs in the recoverable unconscious states, especially the anterior precuneus. The identified cortical hub regions could serve as potential treatment targets for patients with UWS.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- concepts filled out based on ""voxel-wise degree centrality analysis"" as this included construction of a network - unclear how many nodes were used - voxels instead of parcels "			ICA - dual regression, we excluded this right?

Brain age estimation could be useful for investigating patterns of brain maturation and integrity, aiding to elucidate brain mechanisms underlying these heterogeneous conditions. Here, we examined functional brain age in two large samples of children and adolescents and its relation to mental health. Methods: We used resting-state fMRI data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; n = 1126, age range 8-22 years) to estimate functional connectivity between brain networks, and utilized these as features for brain age prediction. We applied the prediction model to 1387 individuals (age range 8-22 years) in the Healthy Brain Network sample (HBN). In addition, we estimated brain age in PNC using a cross-validation framework. Next, we tested for associations between brain age gap and various aspects of psychopathology and cognitive performance. Results: Our model was able to predict age in the independent test samples, with a model performance of r = 0.54 for the HBN test set, supporting consistency in functional connectivity patterns between samples and scanners. Linear models revealed a significant association between brain age gap and psychopathology in PNC, where individuals with a lower estimated brain age, had a higher overall symptom burden. These associations were not replicated in HBN. Discussion: Our findings support the use of brain age prediction from fMRI-based connectivity. While requiring further extensions and validations, the approach may be instrumental for detecting brain phenotypes related to intrinsic connectivity and could assist in characterizing risk in non-typically developing populations.	1126	NA	NA	NA	47	NA	partial correlation	individual	yes (regularisation)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, high-pass filtering) after: age, sex, scan related (motion, temporal SNR), other (site)	no

Emotional bias modification weakens game-related compulsivity and reshapes frontostriatal pathways	BRAIN	Addiction is characterized by compulsive engagement despite adverse consequences. Psychobehavioural interventions targeting compulsivity in addictions are relatively rare, particularly for behavioural addictions like internet gaming disorder (IGD). Free from confounding drug-on-brain effects, IGD provides a promising model for understanding neuropsychological processes of addictions. IGD is a global concern in the setting of increasing internet use worldwide. Thus, developing interventions and understanding their mechanisms of action are important. Positive emotional association biases (EABs) towards addiction cues based on reward conditioning may underlie addiction-associated compulsivity. Here, we developed an EAB modification (EABM) protocol and examined whether modifying EABs via cognitive training would alter neurocognitive aspects of addiction-associated compulsivity in IGD. We recruited 90 IGD participants who were randomly assigned to receive EABM or sham training in a 1:1 ratio (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04068064). The EABM intervention involved six consecutive days of exposure to negative emotional terms linked to gaming stimuli and positive terms linked to non-gaming healthy-alternative stimuli. The sham training involved similar stimuli linked to neutral words. Participants underwent event-related functional MRI while performing a regulation-of-craving task and received several behavioural assessments pretraining and post-training. Primary efficacy measures were changes in gaming-related positive EABs, and compulsive gaming thoughts and behaviours. Behaviourally, EABM (versus sham) training decreased gaming-related positive EABs and compulsive gaming thoughts and behaviours. Neurally, EABM training involved decreased activation in the bilateral dorsal striatum in the regulation-of-craving task and altered left dorsal striatum-centric functional connectivity with ventral prefrontal cortical regions, which correlated with decreases in gaming-related EABs or compulsive gaming thoughts and behaviours. EABM training also implicated activation changes in the right medial frontal gyrus and posterior insula. EABM may reduce compulsive gaming thoughts and behaviours via reshaping functional organization of frontostriatal pathways and insular activity in IGD. The therapeutic potential of EABM should be examined in larger, longer-term studies, as should its application to other addictive disorders. Animal models indicate that abnormalities in frontostriatal circuits underlie addiction-related compulsivity. In a novel psychobehavioural intervention, Wu et al. show that emotional bias modification reduced addiction-related compulsive thoughts and behaviours and reshaped frontostriatal pathways in internet gaming disorder.														yes	missing information		#NAAM?

While structural brain changes such as demyelination are an early hallmark of the disease, a characteristic profile of functional brain alterations in early MS is lacking. Functional neuroimaging studies at various disease stages have revealed complex and heterogeneous patterns of aberrant functional connectivity (FC) in MS, with previous studies largely being limited to a static account of FC. Thus, it remains unclear how time-resolved FC relates to variance in clinical disability status in early MS. We here aimed to characterize brain network organization in early MS patients with time-resolved FC analysis and to explore the relationship between disability status, multi-domain clinical outcomes and altered network dynamics. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data were acquired from 101 MS patients and 101 age-and sex -matched healthy controls (HC). Based on the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS), patients were split into two sub-groups: patients without clinical disability (EDSS <= 1, n = 36) and patients with mild to moderate levels of disability (EDSS >= 2, n = 39). Five dynamic FC states were extracted from whole-brain rs-fMRI data. Group differences in static and dynamic FC strength, across-state overall connectivity, dwell time, transition frequency, modularity, and global connectivity were assessed. Patients' impairment was quantified as custom clinical outcome z-scores (higher: worse) for the domains depressive symptoms, fatigue, motor, vision, cognition, total brain atrophy, and lesion load. Correlation analyses between functional measures and clinical outcomes were performed with Spearman partial correlation analyses controlling for age. Results: Patients with mild to moderate levels of disability exhibited a more widespread spatiotemporal pattern of altered FC and spent more time in a high-connectivity, low-occurrence state compared to patients without disability and HCs. Worse symptoms in all clinical outcome domains were positively associated with EDSS scores. Furthermore, depressive symptom severity was positively related to functional dynamics as measured by state -specific global connectivity and default mode network connectivity with attention networks, while fatigue and motor impairment were related to reduced frontoparietal network connectivity with the basal ganglia. Conclusions: Despite comparably low impairment levels in early MS, we identified distinct connectivity alter-ations between patients with mild to moderate disability and those without disability, and these changes were sensitive to clinical outcomes in multiple domains. Furthermore, time-resolved analysis uncovered alterations in	202	101	101	NA	47	NA	full correlation	aggregated	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering) after: age	no								
Wu, RQ and Wang, F and Yang, PF and Gore, JC and Chen, LM and Wu, Ruiqi and Wang, Feng and Yang, Pai-Feng and Gore, John C. and Chen, Li Min	Graph theory analysis identified two hubs that connect sensorimotor and cognitive and cortical and subcortical nociceptive networks in the non-human primate	NEUROIMAGE	Pain perception involves multiple brain regions and networks. Understanding how these brain networks work together is fundamental for appreciating network-wise changes reported in patients with chronic pain disorders. Parcellating pain related networks and understanding their causal relationships is the first step to understand how painful information is processed, integrated, and modulated, and it requires direct manipulation of specific brain regions. Nonhuman primates (NHP) offer an ideal model system to achieve these goals because cortical and subcortical regions in the NHP brain are established based on a variety of different types of data collected in a way that is not feasible or, at least, extremely difficult in humans (i.e., histology data, tract-tracing, intracerebral recordings). In addition, different methodological techniques can also help characterize and further understand these brain cortical and subcortical regions over the course of development. Here we used a heat nociceptive stimulation that is proven to elicit activity of nociceptive neurons in the cortex to refine and parcellate the whole brain nociceptive functional networks, to identify key network hubs, and to characterize network-wise temporal dynamic signatures using high-resolution fMRI. We first functionally localized 24 cortical and subcortical regions that responded to heat nociceptive stimuli (somatosensory area 1/2, area 3a/3b, S2, posterior insula (pIns), anterior insula, area 7b, posterior parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex, caudate, and mediodorsal (MD) and ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamic nuclei) and used them as seeds in resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data analysis. We applied both hierarchical clustering and graph-theory analyses of the pairwise rsfMRI correlation metrics and identified five cortical and one subcortical sub-networks: strong resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between ACC and prefrontal regions, parietal cortex and area 7b, S2 and posterior insula, areas 3a/3b and 1/2 within the S1 cortex, and thalamic MD and caudate nuclei. The rsFC strengths between cortical areas within each subnetwork were significantly stronger than those between subcortical regions. Regions within each sub-network also exhibited highly correlated temporal dynamics at rest, but the overall dynamic patterns varied drastically across sub-networks. Graph-theory analysis identified the MD nucleus as a hub that connects subcortical and cortical nociceptive sub-networks. The S2-pIns connection joins the sensory and affective/cognitive sub-networks.														yes	wrong population		#NAAM?			dual regression - I though we excluded that?

An interdisciplinary computational model for predicting traumatic brain injury: Linking biomechanics and functional neural networks	NEUROIMAGE	The brain is a complex network consisting of neuron cell bodies in the gray matter and their axonal projections, forming the white matter tracts. These neurons are supported by an equally complex vascular network as well as glial cells. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to the disruption of the structural and functional brain networks due to disruption of both neuronal cell bodies in the gray matter as well as their projections and supporting cells. To explore how an impact can alter the function of brain networks, we integrated a finite element (FE) brain mechanics model with linked models of brain dynamics (Kuramoto oscillator) and vascular perfusion (Balloon-Windkessel) in this study. We used empirical resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to optimize the fit of our brain dynamics and perfusion models to clinical data. Results from the FE model were used to mimic injury in these optimized brain dynamics models: injury to the nodes (gray matter) led to a decrease in the nodal oscillation frequency, while damage to the edges (axonal connections/white matter) progressively decreased coupling among connected nodes. A total of 53 cases, including 33 non-injurious and 20 concussive head impacts experienced by professional American football players were simulated using this integrated model. We examined the correlation of injury outcomes with global measures of structural connectivity, neural dynamics, and functional connectivity of the brain networks when using different lesion methods. Results show that injurious head impacts cause significant alterations in global network topology regardless of lesion methods. Changes between the disrupted and healthy functional connectivity (measured by Pearson correlation) consistently correlated well with injury outcomes (AUC >= 0.75), although the predictive performance is not significantly different (p > 0.05) to that of traditional kinematic measures (angular acceleration). Intriguingly, our lesion model for gray matter damage predicted increases in global efficiency and clustering coefficient with increases in injury risk, while disrupting axonal connections led to lower network efficiency and clustering. When both injury mechanisms were combined into a single injury prediction model, the injury prediction performance depended on the thresholds used to determine neurodegeneration and mechanical tolerance for axonal injury. Together, these results point towards complex effects of mechanical trauma to the brain and provide a new framework for understanding brain injury at a causal mechanistic level and developing more effective diagnostic methods and therapeutic interventions.														yes	wrong outcome (acquisition)		"- data were simulated  - 100 parcels clustered into 7 networks  - edge selection: ""For correlation-based FC, self-connections were deleted, and negative weights were set to zero (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010)."" - aggregated based on: ""One FC matrix was generated by taking the average of the FC matrices obtained using rs-MRI data acquired in 2 phase encoding directions"""

Beyond improving sensorimotor functions, dance training could benefit high-level emotional and cognitive functions. Duo dances also confer the possibility for dancers to develop the abilities to recognize, understand, and share the thoughts and feelings of their dance partners during the long-term dance training. To test this possibility, we collected high-resolution structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 43 expert-level ballroom dancers (a model of long-term exposure to duo dance training) and 40 age-matched and sex-matched nondancers, and measured their empathic ability using a self-report trait empathy scale. We found that ballroom dancers showed higher scores of empathic concern (EC) than controls. The EC scores were positively correlated with years with dance partners but negatively correlated with the number of dance partners for ballroom dancers. These behavioral results were supported by the structural and functional MRI data. Structurally, we observed that the gray matter volumes in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and EC scores were positively correlated. Functionally, the connectivity between ACC and occipital gyrus was positively correlated with both EC scores and years with dance partners. In addition, the relationship between years with dance partners and EC scores was indirect-only mediated by the ACC-occipital gyrus functional connectivity. Therefore, our findings provided solid evidence for the close link between long-term ballroom dance training and empathy, which deepens our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- voxel-wise FC  - 10 nodes based on fig 2  - no mention of thresholding, correlation type		seed-based

Speech cortical activation and connectivity in typically developing children and those with listening difficulties	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Listening difficulties (LiD) in people who have normal audiometry are a widespread but poorly understood form of hearing impairment. Recent research suggests that childhood LiD are cognitive rather than auditory in origin. We examined decoding of sentences using a novel combination of behavioral testing and fMRI with 43 typically developing children and 42 age matched (6-13 years old) children with LiD, categorized by caregiver report (ECLiPS). Both groups had clinically normal hearing. For sentence listening tasks, we found no group differences in fMRI brain cortical activation by increasingly complex speech stimuli that progressed in emphasis from phonology to intelligibility to semantics. Using resting state fMRI, we examined the temporal connectivity of cortical auditory and related speech perception networks. We found significant group differences only in cortical connections engaged when processing more complex speech stimuli. The strength of the affected connections was related to the children's performance on tests of dichotic listening, speech-in-noise, attention, memory and verbal vocabulary. Together, these results support the novel hypothesis that childhood LiD reflects difficulties in language rather than in auditory or phonological processing.	81	42	39	NA	20	3	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression to remove cardiac/respiration artifacts, high-pass filtering) after: age	no			- 3 networks of 16,        20, 24 nodes respectively; averaged for network size

Central to the brain's integrative function are connector hubs, brain regions characterized by strong connections with multiple networks. Given their critical role in functional integration, we hypothesized that connector hubs, including those located in the cerebellum and subcortical regions, are severely impaired in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: We identified brain voxels with significant connectivity alterations in patients with schizophrenia (n = 76; men = 43) compared to healthy controls (n = 80; men = 43) across multiple large-scale resting state net-works (RSNs) using a network metric called functional connectivity overlap ratio (FCOR). From these voxels, candidate connector hubs were identified and verified using seed-based connectivity analysis. Results: We found that most networks exhibited connectivity alterations in the patient group. Specifically, connectivity with the basal ganglia and high visual networks was severely affected over widespread brain areas in patients, affecting subcortical and cerebellar regions and the regions involved in visual and sensorimotor processing. Furthermore, we identified critical connector hubs in the cerebellum, midbrain, thalamus, insula, and calcarine with connectivity to multiple RSNs affected in the patients. FCOR values of these regions were also associated with clinical data and could classify patient and control groups with > 80 % accuracy. Conclusions: These findings highlight the critical role of connector hubs, particularly those in the cerebellum and subcortical regions, in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the potential role of FCOR as a clinical biomarker for the disorder.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		"- association type: FCOR value ""The voxel’s FCOR value was estimated as the spatial extent (number of voxels) of the overlap between the constructed FC map and a reference RSN template divided by the number of voxels comprising the RSN template..."" - whole-brain seed based analysis with 14 seeds  - edge selection: no mention"

Successful memory suppression is associated with hippocampal deactivations and a concomitant disruption of this region's functionality. Much of the previous neuroimaging literature exploring such suppression-related hippocampal modulations has focused on the region's negative coupling with the prefrontal cortex. Task-based changes in functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions still need further exploration. In the present study, we utilize psychophysiological interactions and seed connectome-based predictive modeling to investigate the relationship between the hippocampus and the rest of the brain as 134 participants attempted to suppress unwanted memories during the Think/No-Think task. The results show that during retrieval suppression, the right hippocampus exhibited decreased functional connectivity with visual cortical areas (lingual and cuneus gyrus), left nucleus accumbens and the brain-stem that predicted superior forgetting of unwanted memories on later memory tests. Validation tests verified that prediction performance was not an artifact of head motion or prediction method and that the negative features remained consistent across different brain parcellations. These findings suggest that systemic memory suppression involves more than the modulation of hippocampal activity-it alters functional connectivity patterns between the hippocampus and visual cortex, leading to successful forgetting.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

However, little is known about the possibility of brain recovery after protracted heroin abstinence. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether brain recovery is possible after protracted abstinence in HUs. A total of 108 subjects with heroin addiction completed structural and functional scans, and 61 of those subjects completed 8-month follow-up scans. Resting-state data and 3D-T1 MR images were collected for all participants, first at baseline and again after 8 months. Cognitive function and craving were measured by the Trail Making Test-A (TMT-A) and Visual Analog Scale for Craving, respectively. The cortical thickness and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) differences were then analyzed and compared between baseline and follow-up, and correlations were obtained between neuroimaging and behavioral changes. HUs demonstrated improved cognition (shorter TMT-A time) and reduced craving at the follow-up (HU2) relative to baseline (HU1), and the cortical thickness in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) was significantly greater at HU2 than at HU1. Additionally, the RSFC of the left SFG with the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula, and nucleus accumbens and that of the right SFG with the IFG, insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were increased at HU2. The changes in TMT-A time were negatively correlated with the RSFC changes between the left SFG and the bilateral IFG, the bilateral caudate, and the right insula. The changes in craving were negatively correlated with the RSFC changes between the left OFC and the bilateral SFG. Our results demonstrated that impaired frontal-limbic neurocircuitry can be partially restored, which might enable improved cognition as well as reduced craving in substance-abusing individuals. We provided novel scientific evidence for the partial recovery of brain circuits implicated in cognition and craving after protracted abstinence.														yes	missing information		- no information on keywords, rsFC construction was performed by using FMRIB software Library and Analysis of FUnctional Neuroimages software		no

Previous neuroimaging studies have shown state-dependent functional connectivity and regional amplitude of signal fluctuations in brain gray matter across wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep cycles. However, the functional characteristics of WM during sleep remain unknown. Using simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging data during wakefulness and NREM sleep collected from 66 healthy participants, we constructed 10 stable WM functional networks using clustering analysis. Functional connectivity between these WM functional networks and regional amplitude of WM signal fluctuations across multiple low-frequency bands were evaluated. In general, decreased WM functional connectivity between superficial and middle layer WM functional networks was observed from wakefulness to sleep. In addition, functional connectivity between the deep and cerebellar networks was higher during light sleep and lower during both wakefulness and deep sleep. The regional fluctuation amplitude was always higher during light sleep and lower during deep sleep. Importantly, slow-wave activity during deep sleep negatively correlated with functional connectivity between WM functional networks but positively correlated with fluctuation strength in the WM.

However, there is a paucity of studies focused on adolescent first-episode SZ (AOS), adult first-episode SZ (AFES), and adult chronic SZ (CHSZ). In this study, we investigated regional activity and corresponding func-tional connectivity alterations that have aimed to compare the three disease stages simultaneously. The subjects comprised 49 patients with AOS, 57 patients with AFES, 51 patients with CHSZ, 41 adolescent healthy controls, and 138 adult healthy controls. We compared regional homogeneity (ReHo) between patients at each disease stage with matched healthy controls. We focused on the shared brain regions that showed significant differences between SZ patients at the three different disease stages and healthy controls. Further analysis was conducted to explore whether the patterns of the whole brain functional connectivity alterations were similar. The putamen and medial frontal gyrus (MFG) showed consistently abnormal patterns in AOS, AFES, and CHSZ. Commonly decreased ReHo values in the MFG and increased ReHo values in the bilateral putamen were found in AOS, AFES, and CHSZ. Functional connectivity of MFG remained common abnormality in different SZ stage. In conclusion, ReHo abnormalities in the MFG and the putamen may be common abnormal patterns of brain function in the three different stages of SZ. The vmPFC-dlPFC FC abnormality common occurs in adolescence and adulthood.. This study may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neurodevelopmental abnormality across the AOS, AFES, and CHSZ.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?					
Tao, Y and Tsapkini, K and Rapp, B and Tao, Yuan and Tsapkini, Kyrana and Rapp, Brenda	Inter-hemispheric synchronicity and symmetry: The functional connectivity consequences of stroke and neurodegenerative disease	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases differ along several dimensions, including their temporal trajectories -abrupt onset versus slow disease progression. Despite these differences, they can give rise to very similar cognitive impairments, such as specific forms of aphasia. What has been scarcely investigated, however, is the extent to which the underlying functional neuroplastic consequences are similar or different for these diseases. Here, for the first time, we directly compare changes in the brain's functional network connectivity, measured with resting-state fMRI, in stroke and progressive neurological disease. Specifically, we examined two groups of individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia or non-fluent primary progressive aphasia, matched for their behavioral profiles and distribution of left-hemisphere damage. Using previous proposals regarding the neural functional connectivity (FC) phenotype of stroke as a starting point, we compared the two diseases in terms of homotopic FC, intra-hemispheric FC changes and also the symmetry of the FC patterns between the two hemispheres. We found, first, that progressive disease showed significantly higher levels of homotopic connectivity than neurotypical controls and, further, that stroke showed the reverse pattern. For both groups these effects were found to be behaviorally relevant. In addition, within the directly impacted left hemisphere, FC changes for the two diseases were significantly correlated. In contrast, in the right hemisphere, the FC changes differed markedly between the two groups, with the progressive disease group exhibiting rather symmetrical FC changes across the hemispheres whereas the post-stroke group showed asymmetrical FC changes across the hemispheres. These findings constitute novel evidence that the functional connectivity consequences of stroke and neurodegenerative disease can be very different despite similar behavioral outcomes and damage foci. Specifically, stroke may lead to greater independence of hemispheric responses, while neurodegenerative disease may produce more symmetrical changes across the hemispheres and more synchronized activity between the two hemispheres.	96	55	41	NA	318	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (averages of multiple runs for a single participant)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: gender (sample matching), clinical/psychological (aphasia profile, left-hemispheric damage distribution (all sample matching)), other (education (sample matching)), scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, high-pass filtering) after: scan related (motion), physiological/biological (amount of structural damage)	no			- nodes = average of following: analysis 1 (interhemispheric): 2x174 = 348, analysis 2: power atlas, with 181–234 nodes per person (varied), analysis 3: 357–470 per person  (348+181+234+357+470)/5 = 318

Psychopathy is a personality disorder that includes lack of empathy and concern for others. In the present study, functional MRI was used to examine neural responses and functional connectivity associated with empathy and affective perspective-taking in female inmates (N = 109) with various levels of psychopathic traits, as measured with Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Participants viewed hands and feet in painful or non-painful situations while adopting a first person or third person perspective. All participants demonstrated robust neural responses in anterior insula (aINS), anterior cingulate (ACC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and supplementary motor area (SMA) when viewing pain, both during imagine-self and imagine-other blocks. Psychopathy shifted the functional connectivity seeded in core nodes of the salience and social cognition networks. Perceiving stimuli depicting somatic pain led to decreased functional coupling from right temporoparietal junction to superior temporal sulcus, which correlated with scores on PCL-R Factor 1 (Affective/Interpersonal). In contrast, connectivity from right insula to precuneus increased with Factor 2 (Lifestyle/Antisocial) scores. When adopting a third-person perspective, psychopathic traits modulated connectivity from the social cognition network, but not the salience network, with Factor 1 scores associated with increased connectivity to sensorimotor cortex and temporal pole, while Factor 2 scores were associated with decreased connectivity with ACC/SMA and inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, these results demonstrate that psychopathic traits in incarcerated females are associated with atypical functional connectivity within the salience network during pain-empathy processing and within the social cognition network during affective perspective taking.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		- task based but analysed as gPPI - used gPPI toolbox, not much info beyond that 		PPI	ICA analysis - I thought we excluded this?

We previously proposed that the insula is important in motivating intentional movement via its connections with the dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC). We demonstrated that subjects with PD can increase the right insula-dmFC functional connectivity using fMRI-based neurofeedback (NF) combined with kinesthetic motor imagery (MI). The current study is a randomized clinical trial testing whether NF-guided kinesthetic MI training can improve motor performance and increase task-based and resting-state right insula-dmFC functional connectivity in subjects with PD.Methods: We assigned nondemented subjects with mild PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage & LE; 3) to the experimental kinesthetic MI with NF (MI-NF, n = 22) and active control visual imagery (VI, n = 22) groups. Only the MI-NF group received NF-guided MI training (10-12 runs). The NF signal was based on the right insula-dmFC functional connectivity strength. All subjects also practiced their respective imagery tasks at home daily for 4 weeks. Post -training changes in 1) task-based and resting-state right insula-dmFC functional connectivity were the primary imaging outcomes, and 2) MDS-UPDRS motor exam and motor function scores were the primary and secondary clinical outcomes, respectively.Results: The MI-NF group was not significantly different from the VI group in any of the primary imaging or clinical outcome measures. The MI-NF group reported subjective improvement in kinesthetic body awareness.There was significant and comparable improvement only in motor function scores in both groups (secondary clinical outcome). This improvement correlated with NF regulation of the right insula-dmFC functional con-nectivity only in the MI-NF group. Both groups showed specific training effects in whole-brain functional con-nectivity with distinct neural circuits supporting kinesthetic motor and visual imagery (exploratory imaging outcome).Conclusions: The functional connectivity-based NF regulation was unsuccessful, however, both kinesthetic MI and VI practice improved motor function in our cohort with mild PD.	44	44	NA	NA	268	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band pass filtering) after: other (functional connectivity changes, site)	no			#NAAM?

We performed a randomized controlled trial where we found small positive effects of CT on executive function and processing speed in individuals with PD (n(total) = 140). In this study, we assessed the effects of CT on brain network connectivity and topology in a subsample of the full study population (n(mri) = 86). Participants were randomized into an online multi-domain CT and an active control condition and performed 24 sessions of either intervention in eight weeks. Resting-state functional MRI scans were acquired in addition to extensive clinical and neuropsychological assessments pre- and post-intervention. In line with our preregistered analysis plan (osf. io/3st82), we computed connectivity between 'cognitive' resting-state networks and computed topological outcomes at the whole-brain and sub-network level. We assessed group differences after the intervention with mixed-model analyses adjusting for baseline performance and analyzed the association between network and cognitive performance changes with repeated measures correlation analyses. The final analysis sample consisted of 71 participants (n CT = 37). After intervention there were no group differences on between-network connectivity and network topological outcomes. No associations between neural network and neuropsychological performance change were found. CT increased segregated network topology in a small sub-sample of cognitively intact participants. Post-hoc nodal analyses showed post-intervention enhanced connectivity of both the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the CT group. The results suggest no large-scale brain network effects of eight-week computerized CT, but rather localized connectivity changes of key regions in cognitive function, that potentially reflect the specific effects of the intervention.	71	71	NA	- CT (n=34) + AC (n=37)	300	NA	coherence	individual	no	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression) after: age, sex, other (years of education, cognitive training performance)	no			#NAAM?

Jon	Mapping of whole-cerebrum resting-state networks using ultra-high resolution acquisition protocols	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used in numerous studies to map networks in the brain that employ spatially disparate regions. However, attempts to map networks with high spatial resolution have been hampered by conflicting technical demands and associated problems. Results from recent fMRI studies have shown that spatial resolution remains around 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 mm(3), with only partial brain coverage. Therefore, this work aims to present a novel fMRI technique that was developed based on echo-planar-imaging with keyhole (EPIK) combined with repetition-time-external (TR-external) EPI phase correction. Each technique has been previously shown to be effective in enhancing the spatial resolution of fMRI, and in this work, the combination of the two techniques into TR-external EPIK provided a nominal spatial resolution of 0.51 x 0.51 x 1.00 mm(3) (0.26 mm(3) voxel) with whole-cerebrum coverage. Here, the feasibility of using half-millimetre in-plane TR-external EPIK for resting-state fMRI was validated using 13 healthy subjects and the corresponding reproducible mapping of resting-state networks was demonstrated. Furthermore, TR-external EPIK enabled the identification of various resting-state networks distributed throughout the brain from a single fMRI session, with mapping fidelity onto the grey matter at 7T. The high-resolution functional image further revealed mesoscale anatomical structures, such as small cerebral vessels and the internal granular layer of the cortex within the postcentral gyrus.

Noninvasive approaches for identifying information flow between the motor area and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are critical for evaluation of treatment strategy. We aimed to investigate the direction of the cortical-STN hyperdirect pathway using simultaneous F-18-FDG-PET/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Data were acquired during resting state on 34 PD patients and 25 controls. The ratio of standard uptake value for PET images and the STN functional connectivity (FC) maps for fMRI data were generated. The metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM) approach that combines PET and fMRI data was used to evaluate the direction of the connectivity. Results showed that PD patients exhibited both increased FDG uptake and STN-FC in the sensorimotor area (P-FDR < 0.05). MCM analysis showed higher cortical-STN MCM value in the PD group (F = 6.63, P = 0.013) in the left precentral gyrus. There was a high spatial overlap between the increased glucose metabolism and increased STN-FC in the sensorimotor area in PD. The MCM approach further revealed an exaggerated cortical input to the STN in PD, supporting the precentral gyrus as a target for treatment such as the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

We aimed to investigate how substantia nigra modulates the putamen glucose metabolism using a cross-sectional design. Resting-state fMRI, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) data were acquired. Forty-two PD patients and 25 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for simultaneous PET/MRI scanning. The main measurements of the current study were R-2(*) images representing iron deposition (28 PD and 25 HCs), standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) images representing FDG-uptake (33 PD and 25 HCs), and resting state functional connectivity maps from resting state fMRI (34 PD and 25 HCs). An interaction term based on the general linear model was used to investigate the joint modulation effect of nigral iron deposition and nigral-putamen functional connectivity on putamen FDG-uptake. Compared with HCs, we found increased iron deposition in the substantia nigra (p = .007), increased FDG-uptake in the putamen (left: P-FWE < 0.001; right: P-FWE < 0.001), and decreased functional connectivity between the substantia nigra and the anterior putamen (left P-FWE < 0.001, right: P-FWE = 0.007). We then identified significant interaction effect of nigral iron deposition and nigral-putamen connectivity on FDG-uptake in the putamen (p = .004). The current study demonstrated joint modulation effect of the substantia nigra iron deposition and nigral-putamen functional connectivity on putamen glucose metabolic distribution, thereby revealing in vivo pathological mechanism of nigrostriatal neurodegeneration of PD.														yes	missing information		"- incomplete analysis - no network constructed, instead:  - ""We then averaged the coherence outputs between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz band and considered the averaged coherence as the FC between the bilateral substantia nigra and other voxels."""

We aimed to identify genes associated with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of visual subregions using transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial correlations in discovery and validation datasets. Results showed that rsFC of eight visual subregions were associated with expression measures of eight gene sets, which were specifically expressed in brain tissue and showed the strongest correlations with visual behavioral processes. Moreover, there was a significant divergence in these gene sets and their functional features between medial and lateral visual subregions. Relative to those associated with lateral subregions, more genes associated with medial subregions were found to be enriched for neuropsychiatric diseases and more diverse biological functions and pathways, and to be specifically expressed in multiple types of neurons and immune cells and during the middle and late stages of cortical development. In addition to shared behavioral processes, lateral subregion associated genes were uniquely correlated with high-order cognition. These findings of commonalities and differences in the identified rsFC-related genes and their functional features across visual subregions may improve our understanding of the functional heterogeneity of the visual cortex from the perspective of underlying genetic architecture.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

J. and Aybek, Selma	Multi-centre classification of functional neurological disorders based on resting-state functional connectivity	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	"Background: Patients suffering from functional neurological disorder (FND) experience disabling neurological symptoms not caused by an underlying classical neurological disease (such as stroke or multiple sclerosis). The diagnosis is made based on reliable positive clinical signs, but clinicians often require additional time-and cost consuming medical tests and examinations. Resting-state functional connectivity (RS FC) showed its potential as an imaging-based adjunctive biomarker to help distinguish patients from healthy controls and could represent a ""rule-in"" procedure to assist in the diagnostic process. However, the use of RS FC depends on its applicability in a multi-centre setting, which is particularly susceptible to inter-scanner variability. The aim of this study was to test the robustness of a classification approach based on RS FC in a multi-centre setting.Methods: This study aimed to distinguish 86 FND patients from 86 healthy controls acquired in four different centres using a multivariate machine learning approach based on whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity. First, previously published results were replicated in each centre individually (intra-centre cross validation) and its robustness across inter-scanner variability was assessed by pooling all the data (pooled cross-validation). Second, we evaluated the generalizability of the method by using data from each centre once as a test set, and the data from the remaining centres as a training set (inter-centre cross-validation).Results: FND patients were successfully distinguished from healthy controls in the replication step (accuracy of 74%) as well as in each individual additional centre (accuracies of 73%, 71% and 70%). The pooled cross validation confirmed that the classifier was robust with an accuracy of 72%. The results survived post-hoc adjustment for anxiety, depression, psychotropic medication intake, and symptom severity. The most discriminant features involved the angular-and supramarginal gyri, sensorimotor cortex, cingular-and insular cortex, and hippocampal regions. The inter-centre validation step did not exceed chance level (accuracy below 50%).Conclusions: The results demonstrate the applicability of RS FC to correctly distinguish FND patients from healthy controls in different centres and its robustness against inter-scanner variability. In order to generalize its use across different centres and aim for clinical application, future studies should work towards optimization of acquisition parameters and include neurological and psychiatric control groups presenting with similar symptoms."	172	86	86	NA	88	NA	correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, bandpass filtering)  after: clinical/psychological (symptom severity, comorbidities, medication use), other (site)	no			#NAAM?

However, the rich-club organization and related topological alterations in the CTN brain networks remain unclear. Methods: We simultaneously collected diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 29 patients with CTN (9 males, mean age = 54.59 years) and 34 matched healthy controls (HCs) (12 males, mean age = 54.97 years) to construct structural networks (SNs) and functional networks (FNs). Rich-club organization was determined separately based on each group's SN and different kinds of connections. For both network types, we calculated the basic connectivity properties (network density and strength) and topological properties (global/local/nodal efficiency and small worldness). Moreover, SN-FN coupling was obtained. The relationships between all those properties and clinical measures were evaluated. Results: Compared to their FN, the SN of CTN patients was disrupted more severely, including its topological properties (reduced network efficiency and small-worldness), and a decrease in network density and strength was observed. Patients showed reorganization of the rich-club architecture, wherein the nodes with decreased nodal efficiency in the SN were mainly non-hub regions, and the local connections were closely related to altered global efficiency and whole brain coupling. While the cortical-subcortical connections of feeder were found to be strengthened in the SN of patients, the coupling between networks increased in all types of connections. Finally, disease severity (duration, pain intensity, and affective alterations) was negatively correlated with coupling (rich-club, feeder, and whole brain) and network strength (the rich-club of the SN and local connections of the FN). A positive correlation was only found between pain intensity and the coupling of local connections. Conclusions: The SN of patients with CTN may be more vulnerable. Accompanied by the reorganization of the rich-club, the less efficient network communication and the impaired functional dynamics were largely attributable to the dysfunction of non-hub regions. As compensation, the pain transmission pathway of feeder connections involving in pain processing and emotional regulation may strengthen. The local and feeder sub-networks may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis.	63	29	34	NA	246	NA	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	both	Multiple	Multiple	before: age (sample matching), sex (sample matching), other (education (sample matching)), scan related (motion, detrending), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering) after: age, sex, scan related (head motion), other (education)	no			#NAAM?

What is the source of the spontaneous fluctuation in sustained attention in neural activity, and how does the neural fluctuation relate to behavioral fluctuation? Here, we address these questions by collecting and analyzing two independent fMRI and behavior datasets. We show that the neural (fMRI) fluctuation in a key brain network, the default-mode network (DMN), mediate behavioral (reaction time) fluctuation during sustained attention. DMN shows the increased amplitude of fluctuation, which correlates with the behavioral fluctuation in a similar frequency range (0.01-0.1 Hz) but not in the lower (<0.01 Hz) or higher (>0.1 Hz) frequency range. This was observed during both auditory and visual sustained attention and was replicable across independent datasets. These results provide a novel insight into the neural source of attention-fluctuation and extend the former concept that DMN was deactivated in cognitive tasks. More generally, our findings highlight the temporal dynamic of the brain-behavior relationship.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

The dysregulation of both intra-and inter-network functional connectivities (FCs) of the three NCNs contributed to AD-related cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Brain functional network segregation, integrating intra-and inter-network FCs, is essential for maintaining the energetic efficiency of brain metabolism. The association of brain functional network segregation, together with glucose metabolism, with age-related cognitive decline was recently shown. Yet how these joint functional-metabolic biomarkers relate to cognitive decline along with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD remains to be elucidated. In this study, under the framework of the triple-network model, we performed a hybrid FDG-PET/ fMRI study to evaluate the concurrent changes of resting-state brain intrinsic FCs and glucose metabolism of the three NCNs across cognitively normal (CN) (N = 24), MCI (N = 21), and AD (N = 21) groups. Lower network segregation and glucose metabolism were observed in all three NCNs in patients with AD. More interestingly, in the SN, the coupled relationship between network segregation and glucose metabolism existed in the CN group (r = 0.523, p = 0.013) and diminished in patients with MCI (r = 0.431, p = 0.065) and AD (r = 0.079, p = 0.748). Finally, the glucose metabolism of the DMN (r = 0.380, p = 0.017) and the network segregation of the SN (r = 0.363, p = 0.023) were significantly correlated with the general cognitive status of the patients. Our findings suggest that the impaired SN segregation and its uncoupled relationship with glucose metabolism contribute to the cognitive decline in AD.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

The current fMRI study aimed to explore the neural mechanisms underlying the nostalgia-induced analgesic effect on noxious thermal stimuli of different intensities. Human participants' (males and females) behavior results showed that the nostalgia paradigm significantly reduced participants' perception of pain, particularly at low pain intensities. fMRI analysis revealed that analgesia was related to decreased brain activity in pain-related brain regions, including the lingual and parahippocampal gyrus. Notably, anterior thalamic activation during the nostalgia stage predicted posterior parietal thalamus activation during the pain stage, suggesting that the thalamus might play a key role as a central functional linkage in the analgesic effect. Moreover, while thalamus-PAG functional connectivity was found to be related to nostalgic strength, periaqueductal gray-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PAG-dlPFC) functional connectivity was found to be associated with pain perception, suggesting possible analgesic modulatory pathways. These findings demonstrate the analgesic effect of nostalgia and, more importantly, shed light on its neural mechanism.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		PPI

Control demands are influenced by the strength of the target information itself and by the circumstances in which it is retrieved, with more control needed when relatively weak aspects of knowledge are required and after the sustained retrieval of related concepts. To investigate the neurocognitive basis of individual differences in these aspects of semantic control, we used resting-state fMRI to characterise the intrinsic connectivity of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), implicated in controlled retrieval, and examined associations on a paced serial semantic task, in which participants were asked to detect category members amongst distractors. This task manipulated both the strength of target associations and the requirement to sustain retrieval within a narrow semantic category over time. We found that individuals with stronger connectivity between VLPFC and medial prefrontal cortex within the default mode network (DMN) showed better retrieval of strong associations (which are thought to be recalled more automatically). Stronger connectivity between the same VLPFC seed and another DMN region in medial parietal cortex was associated with larger declines in retrieval over the course of the category. In contrast, participants with stronger connectivity between VLPFC and cognitive control regions within the ventral attention network (VAN) had better controlled retrieval of weak associations and were better able to sustain their comprehension throughout the category. These effects overlapped in left insular cortex within the VAN, indicating that a common pattern of connectivity is associated with different aspects of controlled semantic retrieval induced by both the structure of long-term knowledge and the sustained retrieval of related information.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Aberrant functional metastability and structural connectivity are associated with rumination in individuals with major depressive disorder	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL	Rumination is a repetitive and compulsive thinking focusing on oneself, and the nature and consequences of distress. It is a core characteristic in psychiatric disorders characterized by affective dysregulation, and emerging evidence suggests that rumination is associated with aberrant dynamic functional connectivity and structural connectivity. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we adopted a multimodal approach and tested the hypothesis that white matter connectivity forms the basis of the implications of temporal dynamics of functional connectivity in the rumination trait. Fifty-three depressed and ruminative individuals and a control group of 47 age- and gender-matched individuals with low levels of rumination underwent resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging. We found that lower global metastability and higher global synchrony of the dynamic functional connectivity were associated with higher levels of rumination. Specifically, the altered global synchrony and global metastability mediated the association between white matter integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum to rumination. Hence, our findings offered the first line of evidence for the intricate role of (sub)optimal transition of functional brain states in the connection of structural brain connectivity in ruminative thinking.	96	51	45	NA	21	10	full correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band-pass filtering)  after: age, gender	no			- nodes based on ICA components (10 networks from 21 ICA components)

Conversely, dysregulated DMN is characteristic of major neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the field still lacks mechanistic insights into the regulation of the DMN and effective interventions for DMN dysregulation. The current study approached this problem by manipulating neural synchrony, particularly alpha (8 to 12 Hz) oscillations, a dominant intrinsic oscillatory activity that has been increasingly associated with the DMN in both function and physiology. Using high-definition alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (alpha-tACS) to stimulate the cortical source of alpha oscillations, in combination with simultaneous electroencephalography and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI), we demonstrated that alpha-tACS (versus Sham control) not only augmented EEG alpha oscillations but also strengthened fMRI and (source-level) alpha connectivity within the core of the DMN. Importantly, increase in alpha oscillations mediated the DMN connectivity enhancement. These findings thus identify a mechanistic link between alpha oscillations and DMN functioning. That transcranial alpha modulation can up-regulate the DMN further highlights an effective noninvasive intervention to normalize DMN functioning in various disorders.	36	NA	36	NA	6	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band pass filtering)  after: other (order of group allocation) 	no			#NAAM?

However, little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying functional homotopy. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a discovery dataset (656 healthy subjects) and 2 independent cross-race, cross-scanner validation datasets (103 and 329 healthy subjects) were used to calculate voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) indexing brain functional homotopy. In combination with the Allen Human Brain Atlas, transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial correlation analysis was conducted to identify genes linked to VMHC. We found 1,001 genes whose expression measures were spatially associated with VMHC. Functional enrichment analyses demonstrated that these VMHC-related genes were enriched for biological functions including protein kinase activity, ion channel regulation, and synaptic function as well as many neuropsychiatric disorders. Concurrently, specific expression analyses showed that these genes were specifically expressed in the brain tissue, in neurons and immune cells, and during nearly all developmental periods. In addition, the VMHC-associated genes were linked to multiple behavioral domains, including vision, execution, and attention. Our findings suggest that interhemispheric communication and coordination involve a complex interaction of polygenes with a rich range of functional features.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Here, we analyzed structural and functional brain network development in an accelerated longitudinal cohort spanning 14 to 25 y (n = 199). Core to our work was an advanced in vivo model of cortical wiring incorporating MRI features of corticocorti-cal proximity, microstructural similarity, and white matter tractography. Longitudinal analyses assessing age-related changes in cortical wiring identified a continued differentiation of multiple corticocortical structural networks in youth. We then assessed structure-function coupling using resting-state functional MRI measures in the same participants both via cross-sectional analysis at baseline and by studying longitudinal change between baseline and follow-up scans. At baseline, regions with more similar structural wiring were more likely to be functionally coupled. Moreover, correlating longitudinal structural wiring changes with longitudinal functional connectivity reconfigurations, we found that increased structural differentiation, particularly between sensory/unimodal and default mode networks, was reflected by reduced functional interactions. These findings provide insights into adolescent development of human brain structure and function, illustrating how structural wiring interacts with the maturation of macroscale functional hierarchies.	199	NA	199	NA	200	NA	correlation	individual	yes (thresholding)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (ICA denoising) after: age, scan related (motion), other (average whole-cortex signal, parcellation scheme)	no			#NAAM?

However, data-driven technique like independent components analysis (ICA), can yield unstable and inconsistent results, confounding the true effects of interest and hindering the understanding of brain functionality and connectivity. A key contributing factor to this instability is the information loss that occurs during fMRI data reduction. Data reduction of high dimensionality fMRI data in the temporal domain to identify the important information within group datasets is necessary for such analyses and is crucial to ensure the accuracy and stability of the outputs. In this study, we describe an fMRI data reduction strategy based on an adapted neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) algorithm. Both simulated and real data results indicate that, compared with the widely used data reduction method, principal component analysis, the NPE-based data reduction method (a) shows superior performance on efficient data reduction, while enhancing group-level information, (b) develops a unique stratagem for selecting components based on an adjacency graph of eigenvectors, (c) generates more reliable and reproducible brain networks under different model orders when the outputs of NPE are used for ICA, (d) is more sensitive to revealing task-evoked activation for task fMRI, and (e) is extremely attractive and powerful for the increasingly popular fast fMRI and very large datasets.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		no

Depression mediates the association between insula-frontal functional connectivity and social interaction anxiety	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	High rates of comorbidity between depression and anxiety are frequently observed. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between depression and social interaction anxiety using a dimensional approach. The current study aimed to explore the associations between depression and social interaction anxiety with a multivariate approach in a comparably large dataset (n = 194, 95 males). All participants completed a structural and a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and self-report measures of depression via Beck's Depression Inventory II and social interaction anxiety by social interaction anxiety scale. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) results first identified grey matter volumes of insula were positively correlated with depression dimension scores. Next, whole brain seed-to-voxel analyses were conducted using a VBM-identified insula as a seed region to examine associations between depression/social anxiety and functional connectivity. The results suggested that a significant positive effect of depression/social anxiety was found on the connectivity between insula and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Moreover, variations in depression meditated the association between insula-dlPFC connectivity and social interaction anxiety. Overall, the results indicate that individual differences in depression relate more to insula-dlPFC coupling compared to social interaction anxiety.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?

Sex differences in the functional topography of association networks in youth	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF        AMERICA	Prior work has shown that there is substantial interindividual variation in the spatial distribution of functional networks across the cerebral cortex, or functional topography. However, it remains unknown whether there are sex differences in the topography of individualized networks in youth. Here, we leveraged an advanced machine learning method (sparsity-regularized non-negative matrix factorization) to define individualized functional networks in 693 youth (ages 8 to 23 y) who underwent functional MRI as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Multivariate pattern analysis using support vector machines classified participant sex based on functional topography with 82.9% accuracy (P < 0.0001). Brain regions most effective in classifying participant sex belonged to association networks, including the ventral attention, default mode, and frontoparietal networks. Mass univariate analyses using generalized additive models with penalized splines provided convergent results. Furthermore, transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas revealed that sex differences in multivariate patterns of functional topography were spatially correlated with the expression of genes on the X chromosome. These results highlight the role of sex as a biological variable in shaping functional topography.	693	NA	693	NA	17	NA	not specified	aggregated	yes (regularisation)	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion, linear detrending), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, global signal regression, band-pass filtering) after: age, scan related (motion)	no			"- complicated paper, most info in supplement - create ""individualized networks"" from group network "

Here, we examine blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) correlates of image recognition through the scope of multiple influential systems consolidation theories. We utilize the longitudinal Natural Scenes Dataset, a 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging human study in which similar to 135,000 trials of image recognition were conducted over the span of a year among eight subjects. We find that early- and late-stage image recognition associates with both medial temporal lobe (MTL) and visual cortex when evaluating regional activations and a multivariate classifier. Supporting multiple-trace theory (MTT), parts of the MTL activation time course show remarkable fit to a 20-y-old MTT time-dynamical model predicting early trace intensity increases and slight subsequent interference (R-2 > 0.90). These findings contrast a simplistic, yet common, view that memory traces are transferred from MTL to cortex. Next, we test the hypothesis that the MTL trace signature of memory consolidation should also reflect synaptic ""desaturation,"" as evidenced by an increased signal-to-noise ratio. We find that the magnitude of relative BOLD enhancement among surviving memories is positively linked to the rate of removal (i.e., forgetting) of competing traces. Moreover, an image-feature and time interaction of MTL and visual cortex functional connectivity suggests that consolidation mechanisms improve the specificity of a distributed trace. These neurobiological effects do not replicate on a shorter timescale (within a session), implicating a prolonged, offline process. While recognition can potentially involve cognitive processes outside of memory retrieval (e.g., re-encoding), our work largely favors MTT and desaturation as perhaps complementary consolidative memory mechanisms."	8	NA	NA	NA	30	NA	full correlation	not specified	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion (using GLMdenoise)), physiological (denoising using GLMdenoise) after: other (changes in baseline signal)	no		all info in supplements	#NAAM?

Both forms of deception require inferring others' thoughts and are underpinned by the theory of mind (TOM) neural system. Manipulative truth is thought to more strongly recruit these processes. However, the organization of functional interactions underlying simple deception and manipulative truth remains unclear.Materials and Methods: We performed psychophysiological interaction analysis for a key node in the TOM system, the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), using functional MRI data obtained from 23 volunteers (14 men and 9 women, age range 18-45 years) during the sender-receiver game. During the game, participants sent true, simple deceptive, or manipulative truthful messages to another player according to their own choice. A Bayesian approach to statistics was employed to perform statistical inference and define voxels with significant changes in functional interactions.Results: We observed functional interactions between nodes of the TOM system (bilateral TPJ, left precuneus, left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and right superior temporal sulcus) characterizing both forms of deception. We identified an increment in functional interactions of the rTPJ with the left TPJ (lTPJ) and right precuneus associated with manipulative truth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a higher rate of manipulative truthful actions was associated with weaker functional interactions between the rTPJ and lTPJ, left precuneus, and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.Discussion: Compared with simple deception, manipulative truth is associated with a higher demand for socio-cognitive processes that contributes to the cognitive load of this form of deception. Impact statementThis study contributes significantly to our understanding of the fundamental characteristics of socio-cognitive brain mechanisms. Analysis of psychophysiological interactions is highly relevant to the neurophysiology field to promote a shift from studying local activity changes in brain structures to elucidating the activity-related characteristics of functionally connected regions. The presented research for the first time demonstrates functional interactions between nodes of the theory of mind system underpinning deception through communication of false information and telling the truth to deceive (manipulative truth). Understanding the neural substrates of deception may be applied in the forensic field to develop techniques for detecting deception.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		unclear if network was built 	PPI anlaysis with right TPJ region in the brain as seed region.

Jean	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal variations in aging: The role of neural activity	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been extensively used to study brain aging, but the age effect on the frequency content of the rs-fMRI signal has scarcely been examined. Moreover, the neuronal implications of such age effects and age-sex interaction remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of age and sex on the rs-fMRI signal frequency using the Leipzig mind-brain-body data set. Over a frequency band of up to 0.3 Hz, we found that the rs-fMRI fluctuation frequency is higher in the older adults, although the fluctuation amplitude is lower. The rs-fMRI signal frequency is also higher in men than in women. Both age and sex effects on fMRI frequency vary with the frequency band examined but are not found in the frequency of physiological-noise components. This higher rs-fMRI frequency in older adults is not mediated by the electroencephalograph (EEG)-frequency increase but a likely link between fMRI signal frequency and EEG entropy, which vary with age and sex. Additionally, in different rs-fMRI frequency bands, the fMRI-EEG amplitude ratio is higher in young adults. This is the first study to investigate the neuronal contribution to age and sex effects in the frequency dimension of the rs-fMRI signal and may lead to the development of new, frequency-based rs-fMRI metrics. Our study demonstrates that Fourier analysis of the fMRI signal can reveal novel information about aging. Furthermore, fMRI and EEG signals reflect different aspects of age- and sex-related brain differences, but the signal frequency and complexity, instead of amplitude, may hold their link.														yes	wrong outcome (analysis)		#NAAM?		no

We examined changes in brain networks after social stress using whole-brain resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) by extending our recently published nested-spectral partition method, which quantified the functional balance between network segregation and integration. Acute stress was found to shift the brain into a more integrated and less segregated state, especially in frontal-temporal regions. Stress also stabilized brain states by reducing the variability of dynamic transition between segregated and integrated states. Transition frequency was associated with the change of cortisol, and transition variability was correlated with cognitive control. Our results show that brain networks tend to be more integrated and less variable after acute stress, possibly to enable efficient coping.	30	NA	NA	NA	200	NA	full correlation	individual 	not specified	yes	Multiple	Multiple	before: scan related (motion), physiological (nuisance covariate regression, band pass filtering) after: physiological (variability in BOLD signal)	no			- no mention of edge selection or weights  - first estimate individual networks, then in a second step concatenate these individual networks into a group network.

Here we designed 2 types of novel stimuli-""novel useful and novel useless,"" adapted from ""familiar useful"" designs taken from daily life-to demonstrate how the left and right medial temporal lobe (MTL) respond to novel designs of different usefulness. Taking the ""familiar useful"" design as a baseline, we found that the right MTL showed increased activation in response to ""novel useful"" designs, followed by ""novel useless"" ones, while the left MTL only showed increased activation in response to ""novel useful"" designs. Calculating an asymmetry index suggests that usefulness processing is predominant in the left MTL, whereas the right MTL is predominantly involved in novelty processing. Moreover, the left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) showed stronger functional connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex when responding to ""novel useless"" designs. In contrast, the right PHG showed stronger connectivity with the amygdala, midbrain, and hippocampus. Critically, multivoxel representational similarity analyses revealed that the left MTL was more effective than the right MTL at distinguishing the usefulness differences in novel stimuli, while representational patterns in the left PHG positively predicted the post-behavior evaluation of ""truly creative"" products. These findings suggest an apparent dissociation of the left and right MTL in integrating the novelty and usefulness information and novel associative processing during creativity evaluation, respectively. Our results provide novel insights into a longstanding and controversial question in creativity research by demonstrating functional lateralization of the MTL in processing novel associations."	21	NA	21	NA	4	NA	full correlation	individual	not specified	yes	Scan related	Before network estimation	before: scan related (motion)	no		Paper refers to other paper for data preprocessing, but seems like no denoising/nuisance covariate regression was performed (except for motion)	- ppi, unclear whether thresholded or weighted
